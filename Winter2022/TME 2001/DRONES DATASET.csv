This article focuses on “The Future of Retailing” by highlighting five key areas that are moving the field forward: (1) technology and tools to facilitate decision making, (2) visual display and merchandise offer decisions, (3) consumption and engagement, (4) big data collection and usage, and (5) analytics and profitability. We also suggest numerous issues that are deserving of additional inquiry, as well as introduce important areas of emerging applicability: the internet of things, virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, robots, drones, and driverless vehicles. © 2017 The Authors","Futuristic view; Retailing; Strategy",,,,,,,,,,,"Improving Customer Experience Is Top Business Priority for Companies Pursuing Digital Transformation, According to Accenture Study (2015), https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/improvingcustomer-experience-is-top-business-priority-for-companiespursuing-digital-transformation-according-to-accenture-study.htm, news release, (October 27),; Aguirre, E.M., Mahr, D., Grewal, D., de Ruyter, K., Wetzels, M., Unraveling the Personalization Paradox: The Effect of Information Collection and Trust-Building Strategies on Online Advertisement Effectiveness (2015) Journal of Retailing, 91 (1), pp. 34-49; Ailawadi, K.L., Farris, P.W., Managing Multi- and Omni-Channel Distribution: Metrics and Research Directions (2017) Journal of Retailing, , (in this issue); Amazon, Amazon Go: Frequently Asked Questions (2016), https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011, (accessed December 12, 2016), []; Biswas, A., Bhowmick, S., Guha, A., Grewal, D., Consumer Evaluation of Sale Price: Role of the Subtraction Principle (2013) Journal of Marketing, 77 (July), pp. 49-66; Bradlow, E.T., Gangwar, M., Kopalle, P., Voleti, S., The Role of Big Data and Predictive Analytics in Retailing (2017) Journal of Retailing, , (in this issue); Deloitte, Retail Trends in 2016 (2016), https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/retail-trends-2016.html, (accessed December 12, 2016), []; Grewal, D., Bart, Y., Spann, M., Zubcsek, P.P., Mobile Advertising: A Framework and Research Agenda (2016) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 34 (May), pp. 3-14; Grewal, D., Levy, M., Kumar, V., Customer Experience Management: An Organizing Framework (2009) Journal of Retailing, 85 (1), pp. 1-14; Grewal, D., Roggeveen, A.L., Sisodia, R., Nordfält, J., Enhancing Customer Engagement Through Consciousness (2017) Journal of Retailing, , (in this issue); Inman, J.J., Nikolova, H., Shopper-Facing Retail Technology: An Adoption Decision Calculus (2017) Journal of Retailing, , (in this issue); Kahn, B., Using Visual Design to Improve Customer Perceptions of Online Assortments (2017) Journal of Retailing, , (in this issue); Krishna, A., Cian, L., Aydinoglu, N.Z., Sensory Aspects of Package Design (2017) Journal of Retailing, , (in this issue); Kumar, V., Anand, A., Song, H., Future of Retailer Profitability: An Organizing Framework (2017) Journal of Retailing, , (in this issue); Lemon, K.N., Vehoef, P.C., Understanding Customer Experience Throughout the Customer Journey (2016) Journal of Marketing, 80 (6), pp. 69-96; Mackey, J., Sisodia, R., Conscious Capitalism: Liberating the Heroic Spirit of Business (2014), Harvard Business Review Press Cambridge, MA; Magi, A.W., Share of Wallet in Retailing: The Effects of Customer Satisfaction, Loyalty Cards and Shopper Characteristics (2003) Journal of Retailing, 79 (Summer), pp. 97-106; Marketing Science Institute, Research Priorities 2016–2018 (2016), http://www.msi.org/uploads/articles/MSI_RP 16-18.pdf, Marketing Science Institute Cambridge, MA; Nordfält, J., Grewal, D., Roggeveen, A.L., Hill, K., Insights from In-store Marketing Experiments (2014) Review of Marketing Research: Shopper Marketing and the Role of In-Store Marketing, 11, pp. 127-146. , Dhruv Grewal Anne L.

The emergence of drones challenges traditional notions of safety, security, privacy, ownership, liability, and regulation. With their ability to collect data and transport loads, drones are re-shaping the way we think and feel about our physical environment. However, they also burdened with the perception as being surveillance equipment, and their commercial use has been criticizied by both individuals and activist organizations. In parallel, drones have been legitimized by regulations and licenses from federal agencies, are used by companies for surveying, inspecting, and imaging, and their technological development are driven by active communities of hobbyists and enthusiasts. This tension presents unique challenges to their integration in the currently existing public, governmental and private infrastructure. In this paper, we will take a look at a few of these issues to understand how drones influence society, and present reccomendations for practitioners, policy makers, and reseachers studying this phenomenon. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Business models; Commercial drones; Drones; Privacy; Security; UAVs","Commercial vehicles; Crashworthiness; Data privacy; Drones; Business models; Commercial applications; Federal agency; Physical environments; Security; Societal impacts; Surveillance equipment; Technological development; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); commercialization; security; social impact; unmanned vehicle",,,,,,,,,,"Mackay, H., Gillespie, G., Extending the social shaping of technology approach: ideology and appropriation (1992) Soc.

Through the twentieth century, piloted aircraft made far greater progress than drones. During the twenty-first century, on the other hand, changes in both drone technologies and drone economics have been much more rapid. Particularly in the case of small, inexpensive devices, the question arises as to whether existing regulatory frameworks can cope. To answer that question, it is necessary to document the nature and characteristics of drones, the dimensions across which they vary, the purposes to which they are put, and the impacts that they appear likely to have. The analysis concludes that careful consideration is needed of the adequacy of controls over the impacts of drones on two important values - public safety, and behavioural privacy. © 2014 Xamax Consultancy Pty Ltd.

We investigate the notion of the reduced overall delivery time and energy for a truck-drone network by comparing the in-tandem system with a stand-alone delivery effort. The objectives are (1) to investigate the time and energy associated to a truck-drone delivery network compared to standalone truck or drone, (2) to propose an optimization algorithm that determines the optimal number of launch sites and locations given delivery requirements, and drones per truck, (3) to develop mathematical formulations for closed form estimations for the optimal number of launch locations and the optimal total time of delivery. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the algorithm herein computes the minimal time of delivery utilizing K-means clustering to find launch locations, as well as a genetic algorithm to solve the truck route as a traveling salesmen problem (TSP). The optimal solution is determined by finding the minimum cost associated to the parabolic convex cost function. The optimal min-cost is determined by finding the most efficient launch locations using K-means algorithms to determine launch locations and a genetic algorithm to determine truck route between those launch locations. Findings: Results show improvements with in-tandem delivery efforts as opposed to standalone systems. Further, multiple drones per truck are more optimal and contribute to savings in both energy and time. For this, we sampled various initialization variables to derive closed form mathematical solutions for the problem. Originality/value: Ultimately, this provides the necessary analysis of an integrated truck-drone delivery system which could be implemented by a company in order to maximize deliveries while minimizing time and energy. Closed-form mathematical solutions can be used as close estimators for the optimal number of launch locations and the optimal delivery time. © 2016, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

Some natural controls exist over inappropriate drone behaviour. General liability laws provide remedies for harm that arises from drones, and act as a deterrent against irresponsible behaviour. Specific air safety laws do, or may, apply to drones. Co-regulatory mechanisms provide protections, as may industry and organisational self-regulation. However, a review of current and emergent regulatory arrangements identifies a considerable range of gaps and uncertainties that need to be addressed, particularly in relation to small drones, including micro-drones. © 2014 Xamax Consultancy Pty Ltd.

The model determines the optimal distribution center locations and their corresponding service regions and ordering quantities to minimize the overall distribution cost for the disaster-relief operation. We propose a two-phase CA approach that solves the model efficiently. We conduct extensive sensitivity analysis to reveal insights into how system design varies with key drone design parameters. We use three disaster-prone coastal counties of Mississippi as a testbed to visualize and validate the modeling results. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Continuous approximation; Drone routing; Facility location; Humanitarian logistics; Inventory management","Disaster prevention; Drones; Inventory control; Sensitivity analysis; Continuous approximations; Disaster relief operations; Disaster-affected regions; Distribution costs; Facility locations; Humanitarian logistics; Inventory management; Optimal distributions; Emergency services",,,,,,,,,,"Abounacer, R., Rekik, M., Renaud, J., An exact solution approach for multi-objective location?

To surveillance's promises and threats, drones add a new dimension, both figuratively and literally. An assessment of the impacts of drones on behavioural privacy identifies a set of specific threats that are created or exacerbated. Natural controls, organisational and industry self-regulation, co-regulation and formal laws are reviewed, both general and specific to various forms of surveillance. Serious shortfalls in the regulatory framework are identified. Remedies are suggested, together with means whereby they may come into being. © 2014 Xamax Consultancy Pty Ltd.

In other words, a UAV picks up a package from the truck (which continues on its route), and after delivering the package, the UAV returns to the truck to pick up the next package. Although the hardware for such systems already exists, the extent to which such an approach can actually provide a significantly improved quality of service is not yet understood. By combining a theoretical analysis in the Euclidean plane with real-time numerical simulations on a road network, we demonstrate that the improvement in efficiency is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the speeds of the truck and the UAV. © 2017 INFORMS.","Drone; Routing; Travelling salesman; UAV","Antennas; Drones; Efficiency; Geometry; Quality of service; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Delivery systems; Euclidean planes; Real-time numerical simulations; Road network; Routing; Square roots; Travelling salesman; Trucks",,,,,"Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR: FA9550-15-1-0269

In the last five years, the extension of drone use into commercial applications has grown exponentially apart from military and recreational domains. The growth in domestic use has generated public concern and debate mainly surrounding safety and privacy issues. Guided by a technoethical lens (the study of technology's impact on ethics), a systematic review of commercial drone literature from 2010 to 2015 was conducted to explore social, governance, privacy, and ethical aspects of commercial drone use. Drawing on research, magazine, and newspaper articles, the study identifies the following key areas of social and ethical concern connected with commercial drones: safety, ethics and morals, legality, privacy, air space, informational integrity, humans versus machines, and commercial concerns. The study contributes to technology studies and media ethics research by providing insights into the state of public knowledge concerning commercial drones from an ethical perspective. The outcome of the technoethical review suggests that, although commercial drone use can improve lifestyle and increase efficiency, there is a need to invest more attention to possible negative and unknown consequences to facilitate the ethical use of commercial drones. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Drone; Ethics; Privacy; Regulation; Safety; Surveillance; Technoethics; UAV","Accident prevention; Crashworthiness; Data privacy; Drones; Military applications; Monitoring; Philosophical aspects; Space surveillance; Commercial applications; Ethical perspectives; Ethics; Public knowledge; Regulation; Surveillance operations; Systematic Review; Technoethics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); aerial survey; ethics; regulatory approach; safety; unmanned vehicle; Afghanistan; Pakistan",,,,,,,,,,"Barrett, D., Our surveillance camera for every 11 people in Britain, says CCTV survey (2013) Telegraph, , http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10172298/One-surveillance-camera-for-every-11-people-in-Britain-says-CCTV-survey.html, (2013).

The technology is advanced and regulatory changes are underway which will allow their use in domestic airspace. As well as the functional and economic benefits of a strong civil RPAS sector, the potential benefits for the military RPAS sector are also widely recognised. Several actors have nurtured this dual-use aspect of civil RPAS development. However, concerns have been raised about the public rejecting the technology because of their association with military applications and potentially controversial applications, for example in policing and border control. In contrast with the enthusiasm for dual-use exhibited throughout the EC consultation process, the strategy for avoiding public rejection devised in its roadmap would downplay the connection between military and non-military RPAS and focus upon less controversial applications such as search and rescue. We reflect upon this contrast in the context of the European agenda of responsible research and innovation. In doing so, we do not rely upon critique of drones per se, in their neither their civil nor military guise, but explore the extent to which current strategies for managing their public acceptability are compatible with a responsible and socially beneficial development of RPAS for civil purposes. © 2014, The Author(s).","Drones; Dual-use; Responsible research and innovation; RPAS; UAV","aircraft; airplane pilot; attitude; civil rights; conflict; dual use research; ethics; Europe; human; law enforcement; legislation and jurisprudence; machiavellianism; marketing; military phenomena; procedures; public opinion; rescue work; robotics; social behavior; social control; soldier; technology; weapon; Aircraft; Attitude; Civil Rights; Dissent and Disputes; Dual Use Research; Europe; Humans; Law Enforcement; Machiavellianism; Marketing; Military Personnel; Military Science; Pilots; Public Opinion; Rescue Work; Robotics; Social Control, Formal; Social Responsibility; Technology; Weapons",,,,,,,,,,"Challenging privacy?

Their leadership deficits exacerbate the principal-agent problem between leaders and foot soldiers, who have stronger incentives to harm civilians. We establish the validity of this proposition with a tripartite research strategy that balances generalizability and identification. First, we demonstrate in a sample of militant organizations operating in the Middle East and North Africa that those lacking centralized leadership are prone to targeting civilians. Second, we show that when the leaderships of militant groups are degraded from drone strikes in the Afghanistan-Pakistan tribal regions, the selectivity of organizational violence plummets. Third, we elucidate the mechanism with a detailed case study of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a Palestinian group that turned to terrorism during the Second Intifada because pressure on leadership allowed low-level members to act on their preexisting incentives to attack civilians. These findings indicate that a lack of principal control is an important, underappreciated cause of militant group violence against civilians.

It argues that knowledge created in the last two decades can be characterized as consisting of two distinct eras, i.e., Digitization (1997–2006) and Age of Acceleration (2007–2016), which reflected the general understanding of how technology has transformed our society and economy. Knowledge development within each of these eras is examined in terms of the technological conditions, dominant paradigms, main research questions, and influential discipline and research approaches. Particularly, it recognizes the shift of our view of information technology in tourism research from a primarily a marketing-driven tool to a knowledge creation tool due to new technological conditions such as the smartphone, drone, wearables, new connectivity and big data. Finally, this essay discusses possible future research problems and challenges our existing views of the relationship between information technology and tourism. © 2017","Big data; Information technology; Knowledge management; Research development; Tourism; Tourism management",,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., The long tail: Why the future of business is selling less of more (2006), Hachette Books; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; Fesenmaier, D.R., Wöber, K.W., Werthner, H., (2006) Destination recommendation systems: Behavioral foundations and applications, , CABI; Fesenmaier, D.R., Xiang, Z., (2016) Design science in tourism: Foundations of destination management, , Springer Vienna; Friedman, T.L., Thank you for being late: An optimist's guide to thriving in the age of accelerations (2016), Farrar, Straus and Giroux; Gretzel, U., Fesenmaier, D.R., Building narrative logic into tourism information systems (2002) IEEE Intelligent Systems, 17 (6), pp. 59-61; Laituri, M., Kodrich, K., On line disaster response community: People as sensors of high magnitude disasters using internet GIS (2008) Sensors, 8 (5), pp. 3037-3055; Lazer, D., Pentland, A.S., Adamic, L., Aral, S., Barabasi, A.L., Brewer, D., Life in the network: The coming age of computational social science (2009) Science, 323 (5915), p. 721; Negroponte, N., Being digital (1995), Knopf New York; Pan, B., Fesenmaier, D.R., Online information search: Vacation planning process (2006) Annals of Tourism Research, 33 (3), pp. 809-832; Pine, J., Gilmore, J.H., The experience economy: Work is theater and every business a stage (1999), Harvard Business School Press Boston; Poon, A., Tourism, technology and competitive strategies (1993), CAB international; Sheldon, P.J., Tourism information technology (1997), Cab International; Swan, M., The quantified self: Fundamental disruption in big data science and biological discovery (2013) Big Data, 1 (2), pp. 85-99; Tribe, J., Mkono, M., Not such smart tourism?

Sustainability issues are closely linked in with energy policy, given the desire to increase the proportion of renewable energy. According to the Horizon 2020 climate and energy package, European Union (EU) member countries have to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit by 20%, to increase the proportion of renewable energy to 20% and to improve energy efficiency by 20% by 2020. In this study we aim to assess the opportunities available to exploit solar radiation on roofs with Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and photogrammetry techniques. The surveyed area was in Debrecen, the second largest city in Hungary. An aerial LiDAR survey was conducted with a density of 12 points/m2, over a 7 × 1.8 km wide band. We extracted the building and roof models of the buildings from the point cloud. Furthermore, we applied a low-cost drone (DJI Phantom with a GoPro camera) in a smaller area of the LiDAR survey and also created a 3D model: buildings and roof planes were identified with multiresolution segmentation of the digital surface models (DSM) and orthophoto coverages. Building heights and building geometry were also extracted and validated in field surveys. 50 buildings were chosen for the geodetic survey and the results of the accuracy assessment were extrapolated to other buildings; in addition to this, 100 building heights were measured. We focused primarily on the roofs, as these surfaces offer possible locations for thermal and photovoltaic equipment. We determined the slope and aspect of roof planes and calculated the incoming solar energy according to roof planes before comparing the results of the point cloud processing of LiDAR data and the segmentation of DSMs. Extracted roof geometries showed varying degrees of accuracy: the research proved that LiDAR-based roof-modelling is the best choice in residential areas, but the results of the drone survey did not differ significantly. Generally, both approaches can be applied, because the solar radiation values calculated were similar. The aerial techniques combined with the multiresolution processing demonstrated can provide a valuable tool to estimate potential solar energy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) text mining technique is employed to yield multiple groups of contextually similar terms from future-oriented data sources, comprising both experts’ and the public's concerns regarding future technologies. Resulting term clusters are considered as new abstractions, or so-called scenarios, of future social impacts. Furthermore, the study acquires greater depth and breadth in conceptualizing social impacts through considering condition- and value-related terms as key linking factors to previous social impact-related literature. Our proposed methodology seeks to gain insights into the utilization of future-oriented data sources for the foresight activity, hoping to mitigate public skepticism and pursue a better social acceptance of emerging technologies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Drone; Emerging technology; Foresight; Future-oriented data; Latent semantic analysis; Scenario; Social impact; Text mining","Data mining; Drones; Semantics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Emerging technologies; Foresight; Future-oriented data; Latent Semantic Analysis; Scenario; Social impact; Text mining; Economic and social effects",,,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF

Therefore, many fields are showing increasing interest in utilizing multirotor drones, such as mapping in mining and surveillance in transportation. The construction industry has been a slow adopter of novel technologies. However, multirotor drones have potential to facilitate construction in many aspects. There is, therefore, a need to extensively research their applications and analyze their roles in construction engineering and management. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the current applications of multirotor drones, analyze their benefits and explore their potential in the future of the construction industry. Several main aspects are reviewed and discussed, namely land surveying, logistics, on-site construction, maintenance and demolition. The results reveal that the main contributions are work safety, cost-effectiveness and carbon emission reduction, while there are possible adverse impacts on the basis of current limitations of multirotor drones. However, it can be predicted that the usefulness of drones will continue to increase in the future of the construction industry. Thus, this study will benefit construction managers in raising awareness of the use of these emerging technologies and researchers in further exploring applications of multirotor drones in construction projects. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","construction management;

In this study, we extended the previous vehicle routing models to the hybrid delivery systems by taking into account two important practical issues: the effect of parcel weight on drone energy consumption and restricted flying areas. The flight range of the drones is heavily susceptible to the loaded weight due to the limited battery life. Drones are also not allowed to fly over sensitive facilities regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or temporarily in certain areas due to weather-related conditions. We developed a mathematical model that incorporates these issues and propose a two-phase constructive and search heuristic algorithm to provide computational efficiency of the real-world cases problems. The result of the numerical study demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Drone; Flying sidekick; Heuristic algorithm; Mixed integer programming; Routing; Traveling salesman","Computational efficiency; Energy utilization; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic programming; Hybrid vehicles; Integer programming; Trucks; Vehicle routing; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Energy dependency; Federal Aviation Administration; Flying sidekick; Mixed integer programming; Practical issues; Routing; Traveling salesman; Drones",,,,,,,,,,"Agatz, N., Bouman, P., Schmidt, M., Optimization approaches for the traveling salesman problem with drone (2018) Transport.

Travel, tourism and hospitality, in particular, has been massively impacted by the lockdowns used to maintain social distance to manage the disease. Robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interactions have gained an increased presence to help manage the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals, airports, transportation systems, recreation and scenic areas, hotels, restaurants, and communities in general. Humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, and other intelligent robots are used in many different ways to reduce human contact and the potential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including delivering materials, disinfecting and sterilizing public spaces, detecting or measuring body temperature, providing safety or security, and comforting and entertaining patients. While controversial in the past due to concerns over job losses and data privacy, the adoption of robotics and artificial intelligence in travel and tourism will likely continue after the COVID-19 pandemic becomes less serious.

However, there is still a lack of research about drone food delivery services. Thus, this study examined the importance and necessity of drone food delivery services using the concept of perceived innovativeness. In Korea, a total of 324 samples collected in order to test the proposed model including fifteen hypotheses. The data analysis results showed that perceived innovativeness has a positive influence on attitude toward using drone food delivery services and behavioral intentions including intentions to use and word-of-mouth intentions. In addition, the attitude played an important role in the formation of behavioral intentions. Lastly, this study found the important moderating role of gender and age. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Age; Attitude; Behavioral intentions; Drone food delivery services; Gender; Perceived innovativeness",,,,,,"Dong-A University, DAU","This study is supported by a research grant from Dong-A University .",,,,"Aaker, D., Innovation: Brand it or lose it (2007) CA.

The article provides snapshot information about the diversity of the drone industry, including information about the types of companies, the types of drones being manufactured and operated, their payloads, capabilities and applications. Using self-reported information from industry representatives, it also demonstrates that these stakeholders do not have a clear understanding of European privacy and data protection law, which can impact their levels of liability and protections for individuals on the ground. With respect to regulators and civil society watchdogs, the results demonstrate that law enforcement, commercial and private (or recreational) drone operators are all thought to be associated with significant privacy, data protection and ethical risks, and that recreational operators are thought to carry the highest risks. However, perceptions of high-risk operators vary among different organisations, raising a potential for regulatory fragmentation. The article concludes with a consideration of the implications of these findings for the regulation of privacy, data protection and ethics for civil drone operations. © 2016 Rachel L.

Therefore, this study tried to examine a green image in the context of drone food delivery services. More specifically, this study proposed that a green image of drone food delivery services plays an important role in the formation of attitude toward using the services. In addition, it was hypothesized that the attitude has a positive influence on behavioral intentions including intentions to use, word-of-mouth intentions, and willingness to pay more. Lastly, the moderating role of gender and age was proposed during the theory-building process. A theoretical model, which included 12 hypotheses, was developed and tested using a total of 427 samples collected in Korea. The data analysis results showed that a green image of drone food delivery services has a positive influence on attitude toward using the services, which in turn positively affects three subdimensions of behavioral intentions. Furthermore, gender and age played partly as a moderator. The current paper was the first to study the green image of drone food delivery services, so the findings of this study mean a lot to the theoretical aspect. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","age; attitudes; behavioral intentions; drone food delivery services; gender; green image","age structure; aircraft; gender role; image analysis; public attitude; unmanned vehicle; willingness to pay; Korea",,,,,,"This study is supported by a research grant from Dong‐A University.",,,,"Ahuja, M.K., Women in the information technology profession: A literature review, synthesis and research agenda (2002) European Journal of Information Systems, 11 (1), pp. 20-34. , https://doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000417; Ajzen, I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior (1985) Action control, pp. 11-39. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-69746-3_2, New York, NY, Springer-Velag Berlin Heidelberg; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitudes and the attitude-behavior relation: Reasoned and automatic processes (2000) European Review of Social Psychology, 11 (1), pp. 1-33. , https://doi.org/10.1080/14792779943000116; Alexandris, K., Dimitriadis, N., Markata, D., Can perceptions of service quality predict behavioral intentions?

Recently, several incidents occurred with UAVs violating privacy of the public and security of sensitive facilities, including several nuclear power plants in France. The threat of UAVs to the security of nuclear facilities is of great importance and is the focus of this work. This paper presents an overview of UAV technology and classification, as well as its applications and potential threats. We show several examples of recent security incidents involving UAVs in France, USA, and United Arab Emirates. Further, the potential threats to nuclear facilities and measures to prevent them are evaluated. The importance of measures for detection, delay, and response (neutralization) of UAVs at nuclear facilities are discussed. An overview of existing technologies along with their strength and weaknesses are shown. Finally, the results of a gap analysis in existing approaches and technologies is presented in the form of potential technological and procedural areas for research and development. Based on this analysis, directions for future work in the field can be devised and prioritized. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","drones; nuclear security; threat; unmanned aerial vehicles",,,,,,,,,,,"Atherton, K., (2015) BOEING Unveils Iis Anti-Drone Laser Weapon, , http://www.popsci.com/boeing-unveils-compact-anti-drone-laser, Accessed 28 Aug; Atherton, K., (2016) Trained Police Eagles Attack Drones on Command, , http://www.popsci.com/eagles-attack-drones-at-police-command, Accessed 1 Feb; Bacchi, U., (2016) Paris Attacks: Jihadists Secretly Monitored Belgian Nuclear Scientist for Potential Daesh Dirty Bomb, , http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/paris-attacks-jihadists-secretly-monitored-belgian-nuclearscientist-potential-daesh-dirty-bomb-1544719, Accessed 18 Feb 2016; (2015) How to Use Drones to Improve Nuclear Security, , http:s://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/01/how-to-use-drones-to-improve-nuclear-security, Accessed 12 Sept 2016; Birch, G., Griffin, J., Erdman, M., (2015) UAS Detection, Classification, and Neutralization: Market Survey 2015, , Albuquerque: Sandia National Laboratory, SAND2015-6366; Boeke, S., Veenendaal, M.A., Heinl, C.H., (2015) Civil-Military Relations and International Military Cooperation in Cyber Security: Common Challenges & State Practices Across Asia and Europe, , 7th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Architectures in Cyberspace.

A prototype medical drone that is equipped with an on-board automated external defibrillator (AED) was announced recently to significantly reduce the time it takes for an AED to arrive to a patient's side. As drones are battery-operated and have limited service range, a network of medical drones is required to adequately provide service to a large area. This paper developed a new spatial optimization model, the backup coverage location problem with complementary coverage (BCLP-CC), to aid in the deployment of a network of AED enabled medical drones. By explicitly integrating backup coverage and continuously distributed demand, the BCLP-CC can optimally place drones and the corresponding launch sites while significantly improving backup coverage with minimal loss of primary coverage. Our results show that 90.4% of historical out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Salt Lake County can be responded to within 1 min by using 71 drones and 68 launch sites. In addition, 58.9% of incidents can be served by two or more drones, a significant improvement over existing models. This study shows that drones could significantly reduce life-saving equipment travel times for victims of cardiac arrest by appropriately siting them, which will motivate further research in using UAVs or drones for emergency medical purpose. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Backup coverage; Cardiac arrest; Emergency medical service; Medical drones; Spatial optimization","aerial survey; health services; medical geography; optimization; spatial analysis; travel time; unmanned vehicle; Salt Lake County; United States; Utah",,,,,,,,,,"Alexandris, G., Giannikos, I., A new model for maximal coverage exploiting GIS capabilities (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202 (2), pp. 328-338; Becker, L.B., Pat Ostrander, M., Barrett, J., Kondos, G.T., Outcome of CPR in a large metropolitan area — where are the survivors?

Using the first systematic data set of UAV proliferation, this research note examines the spread of UAVs in the context of scholarly debates about interests versus capacity in explaining policy adoption. The results yield important insights for both IR scholarship and the policy-making community. While countries that experience security threats-including territorial disputes and terrorism- A re more likely to seek UAVs, drone proliferation is not simply a function of the threat environment. We find evidence that democracies and autocracies are more likely than mixed regimes to develop armed UAV programs, and suggest that autocracies and democracies have their own unique incentives to acquire this technology. Moreover, supply-side factors play a role in the UAV proliferation process: A state's technological capacity is a strong predictor of whether it will obtain the most sophisticated UAVs. The theories and evidence we present challenge emerging views about UAV proliferation and shed useful light on how and why drones spread. © 2017 The IO Foundation.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Bodea, C., Hicks, R., International finance and central bank independence: Institutional diffusion and the flow and cost of capital (2015) The Journal of Politics, 77 (1), pp. 268-284; Boyle, M., The race for drones (2015) Orbis, 59 (1), pp. 76-94; Byman, D., Why drones work (2013) Foreign Affairs, 92 (4), pp. 32-43; Caverley, J.D., (2014) Democratic Militarism: Voting, Wealth, War, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Cenciotti, D., (2013) US F-22 Stealth Fighter Pilot Taunted Iranian F-4 Phantom Combat Planes over the Persian Gulf, , http://theaviationist.com/2013/09/19/f-22-f-4-intercept/, The Aviationist, 19 September.

However, very little is understood about public reactions to the technology. Strategies to ‘manage public acceptance’ have so far relied upon several untested assumptions. We conducted public engagement activities to explore citizens’ visions of civil drones. Several insights counteracted the prevailing assumptions. Rejecting the notion of blanket support for or opposition to civil drones, we found that citizens make nuanced decisions about the acceptability of civil drones depending upon the purpose of the flight and the actors involved. The results are positioned in support for calls to strengthen the role of citizens in civil drone development and, in particular, to shift away from the current focus on citizens’ acceptance of civil drone development towards the development ofcivildrones that are acceptable to citizens. © 2015, The Author(s).","Civil drones; Drones; Focus groups; RPAS; UAV","conflict; devices; ethics; human; public opinion; standards; technology; trends; Dissent and Disputes; Humans; Public Opinion; Technology",,,,,,,,,,"Amazon prime air (2015) Retrieved October, p. 5. , http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011; Billitteri, T., Drone warfare: Are strikes by unmanned aircraft ethical?

That is the desire and plan, but uncertainties cloud the paths to this destination. All project work should add value in terms of both the resources consumed and the benefits provided (e.g., scope, quality, technical performance, features, and functions), yet adding value is not always straightforward. Conventional techniques such as earned value management focus on time and cost but do not address quality, uncertainty, risk, and opportunity. An integrated approach is needed to account for all of these. This paper presents an integrated framework for quantifying and monitoring project value in terms of the key attributes that matter to its stakeholders. The framework distinguishes four types of project value: desired, goal, likely , and actual. Project management is value management. Project goals, capabilities, risks, and opportunities are evaluated with respect to each key attribute of the desired value. The project value, risk, and opportunity framework is useful for project planning, monitoring, control, and tradeoff decision support. An example project, developing a drone aircraft, demonstrates the framework's application to project planning and monitoring, including setting project goals that balance risk and opportunity. New indices for risk, opportunity, and learning are introduced to track project progress and operationalize new constructs for researchers. © 2014 IEEE.","Opportunity management; project difficulty; project management; project quality; risk management; setting project goals; technical performance measurement; value management","Risk management; Opportunity management; project difficulty; Project goals; Project quality; Technical performance; Value management; Project management",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR",,,,,"Browning, T.R., A quantitative framework for value, risk and opportunity management in projects (2008) 2nd Annu.

Based on the theoretical relationships between the conceptual constructs, a research model was developed and then assessed using data collected from 397 samples in Korea. The data analysis results showed that the three sub-dimensions of psychological benefits (i.e. warm glow, self-expressive benefits, and nature experiences) play an important role in the formation of positive and negative anticipated emotions. Furthermore, the positive and negative anticipated emotions had a significant influence on desire, which in turn positively affects intentions to use. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anticipated emotions; desires; Drone food delivery services; intentions to use; psychological benefits",,,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., (2012) Building strong brands, , Simon and Schuster,.

Based on a brief overview of the development of the drone industry in recent years, this article examines the co-evolution of drone technology and the entrepreneurial activity linked to it. Our results highlight the industry emergence described as concept validation, including product as well as market growth with different phases of technological meaning change. We argue that further steps are needed to develop drones from nice toys to professional tools—from photography and filming applications to inspection services and large cargo logistics. For innovation managers and entrepreneurs, we describe what triggers the emergence of a technology and attracts the needed actors to unleash its transformative potential. Our research is based on industry reports, news, and market studies as well as interviews with four industry actors. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Drone development; Drone industry; Drones; Emerging industries; Entrepreneurial activity; Technological progress; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Unmanned aircraft systems",,,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Audretsch, D., Sarkar, M.B., The process of creative construction: Knowledge spillovers, entrepreneurship, and economic growth (2007) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 1 (3-4), pp. 263-286; Agarwal, R., Moeen, M., (2015), https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1057%2F978-1-349-94848-2, Entrepreneurial startups (de novo), diversifying entrants (de alio), and incumbent firms.

Airborne engineering is now rapidly developing, enabling the construction of small automatic flying vehicles, so called multicopters or flying drones. The main objective of this study is to design and manufacture the low cost and low weight quadcopter platform prototype for the purpose of the environmental monitoring and research. A multirotor concept was created, which assumed some executive functions i.e. hovering, environmental data acquisition or Global Positioning System movement. On the basis of these assumptions, platform components were chosen. They include: the frame, drives, electronics and software. Also the presentation of the environmental measurement capabilities, with the use of multicopters was done along with the discussion on application capabilities, advantages and disadvantages of Unmanned Aerial Vechicles for analytical agriculture. On the basis of the project, a prototype quadcopter platform was built. During the tests some corrections to specific components were made. As a result of the whole process, a platform that is able to accomplish the tasks was created. All components of the multicopter have been described, materials used, mounting and connecting them, as well as the presentation of the specific device problems. The manufacturing cost of the drone prototype was lower than EUR 500, weight of less than 750 g and the drone performed all assumed tasks, which was considered a success of the project. Scientific value of the paper includes the guidance of cheap and efficient setup along with the applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aerial robotics; Environmental monitoring; Multicopters; Unmanned vehicles","Automobile manufacture; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Drones; Manufacture; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned vehicles; Aerial robotics; Application capability; Design and manufactures; Environmental features; Environmental measurements; Environmental Monitoring; Multicopters; Natural environments; Environmental engineering",,,,,,,,,,"Aber, J.S., Marzolff, I., Ries, J., Small-format Aerial Photography: Principles, Techniques and Geoscience Applications (2010), Elsevier; Allouhi, A., El Fouih, Y., Kousksou, T., Jamil, A., Zeraouli, Y., Mourad, Y., Energy consumption and efficiency in buildings: current status and future trends (2015) J. Clean.

When construction hazards remain unrecognized or the associated safety risk remains unperceived, the likelihood of human errors and injuries increases. Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that a large number of construction hazards remain unrecognized in typical workplaces. Likewise, past research has demonstrated that safety risk is widely underestimated in construction. Therefore, to improve safety performance, a proper understanding of factors that influence hazard recognition and safety risk perception is vital. Toward achieving this goal, the objective of the current study is to evaluate the effect of distractions - which are ubiquitous in construction environments - on the hazard recognition performance and safety risk perception of workers. The study goals are accomplished through an experimental effort involving 70 construction workers representing various specialty trades. The workers were randomly assigned to a distracted or undistracted condition, and their hazard recognition performance and safety risk perception levels were measured using construction case images. The study findings revealed that the distracted workers recognized a smaller proportion of hazards compared with undistracted workers. However, there were no significant differences in the level of perceived safety risk between the two groups. A closer examination of the data revealed that the safety risk perception levels for the undistracted workers are positively related to their hazard recognition performance. In other words, when undistracted workers recognize a larger proportion of hazards, they also perceive higher levels of safety risk. However, no such relationship was observed for the distracted workers, suggesting that the perceived risk was unrelated to or not dependent on their hazard recognition performance. The findings suggest that workplace distractions can adversely affect hazard recognition, safety risk perception, and safety performance. Given that constuction workers are already exposed to numerous distractors in typical workplaces, contractors seeking to introduce emerging technologies such as drones, mobile devices, and smart robots must be cognizant of their potential distracting effects. The current study represents the first empirical effort investigating the effect of workplace distraction on construction hazard recognition and safety risk perception. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction safety; Distraction; Hazard identification; Hazard recognition; Injury prevention; Safety risk perception","Hazards; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Construction safety; Distraction; Hazard identification; Injury prevention; Safety risks; Occupational risks",,,,,,,,,,"Abdelhamid, T.S., Everett, J.G., Identifying root causes of construction accidents (2000) J.

Theorising related to this debate led to self-service technologies, which were implemented to both reduce costs and increase productivity by turning customers into co-producers of services or merely to keep up with technological developments. With the emergence of disruptive technologies, it is imperative to discuss the potential shift from a customer co-created value to a customer–technology relationship that could disrupt the value-based relationship model. In line with advancements in service-delivery drones, and based on the theory of planned behaviour framework, this paper pioneers the discussion on consumers’ intention to accept their use based on their related perceived risks, potential functional benefits, and relational attributes, leading to a new type of relationship with the brand–namely, the customer–drone relationship. This discussion opens a new direction for retailers and academics alike to reflect on during the coming years. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumer–brand relationship; Drones; globalisation; self-service technology","globalization; technological development; unmanned vehicle",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, J., Fournier, S., A Brand as A Character, A Partner and A Person: Three Perspectives on the Question of Brand Personality (1995) Advances in Consumer Research, 22, pp. 391-395; Aaker, D.A., Joachimsthaler, E., (2009) Brand Leadership: Building Assets in an Information Economy, , New York: Free Press; Abosag, I., Farah, M.F., The Influence of Religiously Motivated Consumer Boycotts on Brand Image, Loyalty and Product Judgment (2014) European Journal of Marketing, 48 (11-12), pp. 2262-2283; Ajzen, I., The Theory of Planned Behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Ajzen, I., Driver, B.L., Application of the Theory of Planned Behavior to Leisure Choice (1992) Journal of Leisure Research, 24 (3), pp. 207-224; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitudes and the Attitude-Behavior Relation: Reasoned and Automatic Processes (2000) European Review of Social Psychology, 11 (1), pp. 1-33; Alba, A., (2015), http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/crocs-shoe-store-tokyo-staffed-drones-article-1.2138848, “Crocs Opens Pop-Up Shoe Store in Tokyo Staffed by Drones.”; Algesheimer, R., Dholakia, U.M., Herrmann, A., The Social Influence of Brand Community: Evidence from European car Clubs (2005) Journal of Marketing, 69 (3), pp. 19-34; Anitsal, I., Moon, M., Anitsal, M., Technology-Based Self-Service: Toward a New Retail Format (2002) Marketing Advances in Pedagogy, Process, and Philosophy, pp. 46-151. , Venable B.T., (ed), Greenville, NC: Society for Marketing Advances; Bagozzi, R., The Legacy of the Technology Acceptance Model and A Proposal for A Paradigm Shift (2007) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 8 (4), pp. 244-254; Chen, S.C., Chen, H.H., Chen, M.F., Determinants of Satisfaction and Continuance Intention Towards Self-Service Technologies (2009) Industrial Management & Data Systems, 109 (9), pp. 1248-1263; Chen, H., Chen, E., Yeh, A., The Effects of Relationship Commitment and Trust on Business to Consumer Electronic Commerce-the Case of Taiwan (2014) Communications of the IIMA, 3 (4), pp. 35-45; Clarke, R., Moses, L., The Regulation of Civilian Drones’ Impacts on Public Safety (2014) Computer Law & Security Review, 30 (3), pp. 263-285; Daamen, D., Van der Lans, I., Midden, C., Cognitive Structures in the Perception of Modern Technologies (1990) Science, Technology & Human Values, 15 (2), pp. 202-225; Dabholkar, P., Incorporating Choice into an Attitudinal Framework: Analyzing Models of Mental Comparison Processes (1994) Journal of Consumer Research, 21, pp. 100-118; Dabholkar, P., Consumer Evaluations of new Technology-Based Self-Service Options: an Investigation of Alternative Models of Service Quality (1996) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 13, pp. 29-51; Dabholkar, P., Bagozzi, R., An Attitudinal Model of Technology-Based Self-Service: Moderating Effects of Consumer Traits and Situational Factors (2002) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 30 (3), pp. 184-201; Dai, X., (2015), “Aranica: Commercialization of a Drone Mapping and Sensing Technology.” Master diss., The Arctic University of Norway; D’Andrea, R., Guest Editorial Can Drones Deliver?

Many have raised concerns about their interaction with other aircraft and safety or that they may be used to conduct covert and potentially persistent surveillance on members of the public. UAV use in warfighting has demonstrated drones' technical capability for tactical use. The use of armed UAVs in United States territory has, in spite of this, received minimal consideration and a general government response that this would not be allowed to occur. This paper suggests that the use of armed UAVs by civilian authorities is appropriate and even desirable in certain circumstances. It considers rules of use for armed UAVs in the context of law enforcement and also discusses the additional considerations applicable to the use of autonomously controlled UAVs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Domestic drone use; Law enforcement; Unmanned aerial system (UAS); Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); Use of force","Aircraft detection; Law enforcement; Target drones; Unmanned vehicles; Civilian authorities; Domestic drone use; General governments; Persistent surveillance; Technical capabilities; Unmanned aerial systems; Use of force; War fighting; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); aircraft; government; law enforcement; space technology; unmanned vehicle; United States",,,,,,,,,,"Awad, A.I., (2013) An analysis of the risk from UAS missions in the national airspace; Weibel, R.E., Hansman, R.J., An integrated approach to evaluating risk mitigation measures for UAV operational concepts in the NAS (2005) Proceedings of InfoTech at aerospace: advancing contemporary aerospace technologies and their integration, 1, pp. 509-519; Villasenor, J., Privacy, security, and human dignity in the digital age: observations from above: unmanned aircraft systems and privacy (2013) Harv JL & Pub Pol'y, 36, pp. 457-915; Roberts, T., On the radar: government unmanned aerial vehicles and their effect on public privacy interests from fourth amendment jurisprudence and legislative policy perspectives (2008) Jurimetrics, 49, p. 491; Schlag, C., The new privacy battle: how the expanding use of drones continues to Erode our concept of privacy and privacy rights (2013) Pittsburgh J Technol Law Policy, 13; Vacek, J.J., Big brother will soon be watching-or will be-constitutional, regulatory, and operational issues surrounding the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in law enforcement (2009) NDL Rev, 85, p. 673; Davis, J., The (Common) law of man over (Civilian) vehicles unmanned (2011) J Law Inform Sci, 21, pp. 1-15; Anand, S., Domestic use of unmanned aircraft systems: an evaluation of policy constraints and the role of industry consensus standards (2007) ASTM Stand News, 35, p. 30; Henderson, I., Cavanagh, B., (2013) Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs): do they pose legal challenges?

A drone is a flying computer. It is dependent on local data communications from its onboard sensors and to its onboard effectors, and on telecommunications links over which it receives data-feeds and command-feeds from terrestrial and perhaps airborne sources and from satellites. A drone acts on the world, and is therefore a robot. The remote pilots, and the operators of drone facilities such as cameras, depend on high-tech tools that interpret data that display transmitted, enhanced and generated image and video, and that enable the composition of commands. So drone operators are already cyborgs. Many drones carry cameras and are used for surveillance. Computing, data communications, robotics, cyborgisation and surveillance offer power and possibilities, but with them come disbenefits and risks. Critical literatures exist in relation to all of those areas. An inspection of those literatures should provide insights into the limitations of drones, and the impacts and implications arising from their use. © 2014 Xamax Consultancy Pty Ltd.

Likewise in many other aspects of life, energy is crucial for military forces. In parallel to the changing nature of warfare, the need for energy in military operations has increased dramatically. While energy consumption in the World War II was 1. gal per soldier per day, it was 4. gal per soldier per day during the Desert Storm operation in 1991. Not only the quantity, but also the type of energy required for military operations has changed dramatically. Shifts have been observed from individual man power to machines powered by fuel and electricity. Energy demand and type have changed further through the introduction of more sophisticated devices with new capabilities such as to enable night vision, designate targets with lasers, provide advanced sensing and communication capabilities and reduce human involvement in operations through drones and robotic technologies. Investigating the trends in changing nature of warfare and energy through review, technology mining and scientometrics, the present study develops future scenarios, and a strategic roadmap to identify priority technology areas and strategies for the future military energy R&D. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Defense; Emerging technologies; Energy; Military R&D; Scenarios; Strategies; Sustainability","Energy utilization; Military operations; Social robots; Defense; Emerging technologies; Energy; Scenarios; Strategies; Sustainable development; civil war; energy efficiency; energy use; military application; research and development; strategic approach; sustainability",,,,,"Government Council on Grants, Russian Federation","Dr. Ozcan Saritas' contribution in this publication was supported within the framework of the Basic Research Program at the National Research University HSE and was funded within the framework of the subsidy granted to the HSE by the Government of the Russian Federation for the implementation of the Global Competitiveness Program.",,,,"Aliberti, K., Bruen, T.L., Energy on demand (2007) Army Logistician, 39, p. 1. , http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/janfeb07/energy_demand.html; Arreguín-Toft, I., How the weak win wars: a theory of asymmetric conflict (2001) Int.

However, little research has been reported regarding the strategies that construction site technology vendors use to disseminate their products into the construction market. This paper addresses this gap in construction innovation research by focusing on construction site technology exhibitions as a specific technology innovation dissemination strategy. Using observational and documentary data collected from 221 vendors at two technology exhibitions in Australia, hard and fuzzy clustering analysis techniques were used to develop a new vendor dissemination classification framework that shows that construction technology vendors can be classified into five types by the range of dissemination strategies they use. These dissemination strategies can then be classified into five types based on their orientation to physical appearance, interpersonal relationships, and technology demonstration. The results show that the combinations of these strategies are directly related to the type of technology being disseminated. This research and the new theoretical framework presented represent an important counterpoint to the disproportionate focus on customers rather than vendors in the construction innovation literature and the historical focus on information communication technologies (ICTs) rather than emerging construction site technologies. It also addresses a neglect in construction innovation research of recent developments in mainstream innovation research that recognize the importance of customer-vendor relationships. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction technology; Diffusion; Dissemination; Exhibitions; Strategy; Technology vendors","Construction industry; Diffusion; Classification framework; Construction technologies; Dissemination; Fuzzy clustering analysis; Information communication technology; Interpersonal relationship; Strategy; Technology vendors; Exhibitions",,,,,,,,,,"Alp Erilli, N., Yolcu, U., Eǧrioǧlu, E., Hakan Aladaǧ, C., Öner, Y., Determining the most proper number of cluster in fuzzy clustering by using artificial neural networks (2011) Expert Syst.

Construction research has also neglected to adequately consider the important role of vendors in the innovation diffusion process, focussing mostly on the role of the customer. Set within the context of Australia’s construction industry, the purpose of this paper is to address these gaps in knowledge by exploring the role of customers and vendors in the diffusion of modern equipment technologies into the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: Using contemporary models of innovation diffusion which move beyond the simple dualistic problem of whether innovation is supply-pushed or demand-pulled, 19 semi-structured interviews were undertaken with customers and vendors involved in two major modern equipment technology trade exhibitions in Australia. This was followed by the collection of documentary data in the form of photos, directory books, marketing material, catalogues, websites and booth and exhibition layouts to validate the proposed model and provide insights into vendor marketing strategies. These data were analysed using both content analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Findings: According to the PCA and content analysis, vendor’s engagement in the adoption of modern equipment technologies falls into three stages that correspond to three stages in the customer’s adoption process. In the first stage, customers identify possible solutions and recognise new technologies following a previous recognition of a need. Vendors provide facilities for attracting potential customers and letting customers know that their technology exists and can help solve the customer’s problem. The second stage involves customers gaining knowledge about the details of the new technology, and vendors focusing on detailed knowledge transfer through written materials and demonstrations of the functionality of the new technology. In the third stage, customers have specific questions that they want answered to assist them in comparing different vendors and solutions. By this stage, vendors have built a close relationship with the customer and in contrast to earlier stages engage in two-way communication to help the customer’s decision process by addressing specific technical and support-related questions. Originality/value: The originality and value of this research is in addressing the lack of research in modern equipment technology adoption for building construction and the lack of data on the role of vendors in the process by developing a new empirical framework which describes the stages in the process and the ways that customers and vendors interact at each stage. The results indicate that conceptually, as the construction industry becomes more industrialised, current models of innovation adoption will need to develop to reflect this growing technological complexity and recognise that vendors and customers engage differently in the adoption process, according to the type of technology they wish to adopt. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction;

This analysis is an effort to weigh the ethical prospects and problems in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles by asking whether surveillance of civilians is ethical. To address this question, classical philosophical and modern behavioral approaches to ethics are used. The inquiry begins with the importance of the issue, followed by its evolution and current status. After describing the method of analysis, the article examines arguments for and against domestic monitoring. The unique utility of drones can accomplish much in the public interest while simultaneously creating moral hazards. The conclusion discusses accountability standards, model legislation provisions, and regulatory criteria for aerial vehicle surveillance. © 2016 by The American Society for Public Administration",,,,,,,,,,,,"Abril, P.S., Levin, A., Del Riego, A., Blurred Boundaries: Social Media Privacy and the Twenty-First Century Employee (2012) American Business Law Journal, 49 (1), pp. 63-124; Adams, R., Barrie, C., The Bureaucratization of War: Moral Challenges Exemplified by the Covert Lethal Drone (2013) Ethics and Global Politics, 6 (4), pp. 245-260; Alder, G.S., Ethical Issues in Electronic Performance Monitoring: A Consideration of Deontological and Teleological Perspectives (1998) Journal of Business Ethics, 17 (7), pp. 729-743; Arkin, R.C., (2009) Governing Lethal Behavior in Autonomous Robots, , Boca Raton, FL, CRC Press; (2015) Analysis of the First 1,000 Commercial UAS Exemptions, , http://auvsilink.org/advocacy/Section333.html, [accessed November 17, 2015]; Ball, K., Workplace Surveillance: An Overview (2010) Labor History, 51 (1), pp. 87-106; Ball, K.S., Margulis, S.T., Electronic Monitoring and Surveillance in Call Centres: A Framework for Investigation (2011) New Technology, Work and Employment, 26 (2), pp. 113-126; Bazerman, M.H., Tenbrunsel, A.E., (2011) Blind Spots: Why We Fail to Do What's Right and What to Do about It, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Bennett, B., Police Employ Predator Drone Spy Planes on Home Front (2011) Los Angeles Times, (December 10). , http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/10/nation/la-na-drone-arrest-20111211, [accessed November 17, 2015]; Bone, E., Bolkcom, C., Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Background and Issues for Congress.

In addition, this study deepened the theoretical framework by considering the moderating role of product knowledge about the pro-environmental role of the drone-based food delivery services. Sixteen hypotheses were tested using a total of 401 samples collected in Korea. The data analysis results indicated that all hypotheses within the model that merged the NAM and the TPB were statistically supported. Furthermore, product knowledge played a moderating role in the relationship between (1) ascribed responsibility and personal norm, (2) attitudes and behavioral intentions, and (3) subjective norm and personal norm. © 2019 CAUTHE - COUNCIL FOR AUSTRALASIAN TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY EDUCATION","Drone food delivery services; Norm activation model; Pro-environmental role; Product knowledge; Theory of planned behavior",,,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Understanding attitude and predicting social behavior.

Furthermore, this study investigates the relationship between perceived risk and image of drone food delivery services. Lastly, this study examines the effect of image of drone food delivery services on desire, intentions to use and willingness to pay more. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected data from 331 respondents in Korea. Before the start of the survey, the respondents were given a video, which made it easier for them to understand drone food delivery services. Findings: The three types of perceived risks (i.e. time risk, performance risk and psychological risk) have a negative influence on image of drone food delivery services and, thus, aids in increasing desire, intentions to use and willingness to pay more. Originality/value: The concept of perceived risk was applied to the context of drone food delivery services in this study in combination with other understudied concepts, image, desire, intentions to use and willingness to pay more. This study is one of the first studies that applied those significant concepts to the context of drone food delivery services, even though there are a large number of papers in the technology field. Thus, the findings of this study will be important to foodservice companies when building successful drone food delivery services. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Desire; Drone food delivery services; Image; Intentions to use; Perceived risk; Willingness to pay more",,,,,,,,,,,"Aghekyan-Simonian, M., Forsythe, S., Kwon, W.S., Chattaraman, V., The role of product Brand image and online store image on perceived risks and online purchase intentions for apparel (2012) Journal of Retailing and Customer Services, 19 (3), pp. 325-331; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Anja, A., (2016) Digital sushi: how blue C is innovating the restaurant industry, , https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/digital-sushi-how-blue-c-is-innovating-the-restaurant-industry/, Open Knowledge; Bamburry, D., Drones: designed for product delivery (2015) Design Management Review, 26 (1), pp. 40-48; Bauer, R.A., Customer behavior and risk taking (1960) Dynamic Marketing for a Changing World, pp. 389-398. , Hancock, R.S.

In addition, this study proposed that the attitude positively affects desire and behavioral intentions. Based on the proposed relationships among the constructs, a conceptual model was developed and evaluated using data collected from 320 respondents in Korea. The data analysis results revealed that three dimensions of motivated consumer innovativeness except for cognitively motivated consumer innovativeness are important predictors of attitude. In addition, functionally motivated consumer innovativeness had a positive influence on behavioral intentions. Lastly, the attitude was shown to significantly increase desire and behavioral intentions. © 2019 CAUTHE - COUNCIL FOR AUSTRALASIAN TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY EDUCATION","Attitude; Behavioral intentions; Desire; Drone food delivery services; Motivated consumer innovativeness",,,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitude and the attitude-behavior relation: Reasoned and automatic processes (2000) European Review of Social Psychology, 11 (1), pp. 1-33; Ajzen, I., Madden, T.J., Prediction of goal-directed behavior: Attitude, intentions, and perceived behavioral control (1986) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 22, pp. 453-474; Amoako-Gyampah, K., Salam, A.F., An extension of the technology acceptance model in an ERP implementation environment (2004) Information & Management, 41 (6), pp. 731-745; Asia Economy, “Stop fast now”: Every year 1548 food deliveries, dead or injured during delivery (2017), http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2017092611430473709, Retrieved from; Babin, B.J., Darden, W.R., Griffin, M., Work and/or fun: Measuring hedonic and utilitarian shopping value (1994) Journal of Consumer Research, 20 (4), pp. 644-656; Bagozzi, R.P., Dholakia, U.M., Basuroy, S., How effortful decisions get enacted: The motivating role of decision processes, desire, and anticipated emotions (2003) Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 16 (4), pp. 273-295; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16 (1), pp. 74-94; Batra, R., Ahtola, O.T., Measuring the hedonic and utilitarian sources of consumer attitude (1990) Marketing Letters, 2 (2), pp. 159-170; Bearden, W., Netemeyer, R., Handbook of marketing scales: Multi-item measures for marketing and consumer behavior research (1999), 2ed.

The purpose of this paper is to consider the advantages and challenges inherent in the use of long endurance remotely piloted aircraft systems (LE-RPAS) aircraft to support the provision of medical supplies to remote locations – specifically “medical maggots” used in maggot debridement therapy (MDT) wound care. Design/methodology/approach: After introducing both MDT and the LE-RPAS technology, the paper first reports on the outcomes of a case study involving 11 semi-structured interviews with individuals who either have experience and expertise in the use of LE-RPAS or in the provision of healthcare to remote communities in Western Australia. The insights gained from this case study are then synthesised to assess the feasibility of LE-RPAS assisted delivery of medical maggots to those living in such geographically challenging locations. Findings: No insuperable challenges to the concept of using LE-RPAS to transport medical maggots were uncovered during this research – rather, those who contributed to the investigations from across the spectrum from operators to users, were highly supportive of the overall concept. Practical implications: The paper offers an assessment of the feasibility of the use of LE-RPAS to transport medical maggots. In doing so, it highlights a number of infrastructure and organisational challenges that would need to be overcome to operationalise this concept. Whilst the particular context of the paper relates to the provision of medical support to a remote location of a developed country, the core benefits and challenges that are exposed relate equally to the use of LE-RPAS in a post-disaster response. To this end, the paper offers a high-level route map to support the implementation of the concept. Social implications: The paper proposes a novel approach to the efficient and effective provision of medical care to remote Australian communities which, in particular, reduces the need to travel significant distances to obtain treatment. In doing so, it emphasises the importance in gaining acceptance of both the use of MDT and also the operation of RPAS noting that these have previously been employed in a military, as distinct from humanitarian, context. Originality/value: The paper demonstrates how the use of LE-RPAS to support remote communities offers the potential to deliver healthcare at reduced cost compared to conventional approaches. The paper also underlines the potential benefits of the use of MDT to address the growing wound burdens in remote communities. Finally, the paper expands on the existing discussion of the use of RPAS to include its capability to act as the delivery mechanism for medical maggots. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Drone; Humanitarian logistics; Maggot debridement therapy; Remotely piloted aircraft systems; Unmanned aerial vehicle",,,,,,,,,,,"(2016) Amazon Prime Air, , www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011, December 2016, :, (accessed; Ambrosia, V.G., Wegener, S., Zajkowliski, T., The Ikhana unmanned airborne system (UAS) western states fire imaging missions: from concept to reality (2006-2010) (2011) Geocarto International, 26 (2), pp. 85-101; (2015) Drones for disaster response and relief operations, , www.zurichna.com/en/search?q=Drones+for+Disaster+Response+and+Relief+Operations&page=2#, December 2016, American Red Cross, New Orleans, :, (accessed; Ateudjieu, J., Kenfack, B., Nkontchou, B.W., Demanou, M., Program on immunization and cold chain monitoring: the status in eight health districts in Cameroon (2013) BMC Research Notes, 6, p. 101; (2016) UAS certificate holders, , www.casa.gov.au/aircraft/standard-page/uas-certificate-holders, Canberra, 19 December 2016, :, (accessed; (2016) UAS airworthiness framework; DP 1529US – June 2016, , www.casa.gov.au/standard-page/dp-1529us-uas-airworthiness-framework, December 2016, CASA’s Standards Division, Australian Government, Canberra, :, (accessed; (2016) The constituency of Durack, , www.aec.gov.au/profiles/wa/durack.htm, December 2016, :, (accessed; (2016) Australia’s health 2016, , www.aihw.gov.au/publication-detail/?id=60129555544, February 2017, :, (accessed; (1999) First Atlantic crossing by an unmanned aircraft, , www.barnardmicrosystems.com/UAV/milestones/atlantic_crossing_1.html, December 2016, :, (accessed; Bednowitz, N., Batta, R., Nagi, R., Dispatching and loitering policies for unmanned aerial vehicles under dynamically arriving multiple priority targets (2014) Journal of Simulation, 8 (1), pp. 9-24; BioBag Ordering Guide, , http://biomonde.com/images/US_Linked_Docs/BM029_US_02_0215.pdf, May 2017, :, (accessed; Bogue, R., Robots for monitoring the environment (2011) The Industrial Robot, 38 (6), pp. 560-566; Bogue, R., Search and rescue and disaster relief robots: has their time finally come?

However, its efficiency has always been limited by the primary method of reading barcodes with a handheld laser scanner. Compared with this reading by line-of-sight at close proximity, vision-based barcode reading algorithms can further improve efficiency, particularly if accompanied by automated data collection platforms such as drones. This paper introduces algorithms that are able to automatically extract barcodes from video data, and verifies their feasibility and promise for inventory management in warehousing applications. Three key techniques corresponding to different recognition levels are proposed: For a known barcode region, a Harris corner detector and Hough transform-based algorithm is applied to quickly estimate the angle by which the frame area needs to rotate to orient the bars vertically for information extraction. Then, the idea of exploiting connectivity and geometry property of barcode areas is proposed to directly recognise multiple barcode regions in a single video frame to eliminate reading difficulties resulting from interactive influence of multiple juxtaposed barcodes, and to save computation time by only processing frame areas of interest for valid barcodes. In addition, a histogram difference-based fast extraction strategy is designed to further improve efficiency by reducing duplicate information processing. Finally, the performance of each technique is evaluated by analysing video data from a large logistics warehouse, demonstrating satisfactory performance in inventory management applications. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",": 1D barcode;

Markets for commercial drone use are in the technology trigger phase of the Gartner Group’s Hyper Cycle, with developments occurring rapidly in real estate, agriculture (farming), the film industry, insurance, and other areas. Examination and inspection applications of drones have been proposed in heavy industry and cell tower inspection. Previous research suggests an incremental structure for implementing technological innovations such as continuous auditing (CA). In this paper these proposals are expanded to include the additional requirements to add drone technologies. This structure is extended here by (1) defining the use of drones in audit environments, with emphasis on the continuous versus occasional use of drone technologies, (2) extending the technical adoption architecture to include the use of drones, and (3) considering the types of drone usages amenable to both internal and external audits. A specific architecture is proposed here to prototype inventory counts in large warehouses or open-air inventories and that satisfies the suggested requirements. Additionally, this proposal adds value to the current research by extending the discussion of technology adoption in the Alles, Kogan, and Vasarhelyi (2008) paper to include the use of drones in many different audit environments by enumerating the usage types of drones in audit settings and by considering the prototype of such a system. © 2017, American Accounting Association.

These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing. © 2020 The Authors","Cumulative prospect theory; Hesitant fuzzy set; Industry 4.0; Sustainability; Technology; VIKOR","Automotive industry; Decision theory; Economics; Electronics industry; Industry 4.0; Planning; Shoe manufacture; Telecommunication equipment; Textile industry; Cumulative prospect theory; Industrial revolutions; Production efficiency; Social and environmental; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainability impacts; Sustainable performance; Technology adoption; Sustainable development",,,,,"Innovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, AIC: 71772032, 71472031

Notwithstanding this, companies still face the problem of understanding the opportunities enabled by technologies from the early stage of development. The technology management literature highlights that development is usually managed by adopting one of two approaches: normative or explorative. However, in using the latter approach focused on developing emerging technologies, unanswered questions remain. In particular, this paper aims to shed light on the strategies that companies adopt to unveil the opportunities enabled by emerging technologies. Analysing the drone industry using an exploratory case study approach, we investigate the strategies that companies implement to guide technology development to address more meaningful application fields. Using the Federal Aviation Administration database, we identify four possible strategies to develop emerging technologies: focus, deep, broad, and holistic. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Technology development; technology epiphanies; unlock opportunities","aircraft; development strategy; policy implementation; technological development; unmanned vehicle",,,,,,,,,,"Adner, R., Kapoor, R., Innovation Ecosystems and the Pace of Substitution: Re-Examining Technology S-Curves (2016) Strategic Management Journal, 37, pp. 625-648; Adner, R., Levinthal, D., Demand Heterogeneity and Technology Evolution: Implications for Product and Process Innovation (2001) Management Science, 47 (5), pp. 611-628; Bahrami, H., Evans, S., Strategy Making in High-Technology Firms: The Empiricist Mode (1989) California Management Review, 31 (2), pp. 107-128; Becker, M.C., Salvatore, P., Zirpoli, F., The Impact of Virtual Simulation Tools on Problem-Solving and new Product Development Organization (2005) Research Policy, 34 (9), pp. 1305-1321; Bingham, C.B., Furr, N.R., Eisenhardt, K.M., The Opportunity Paradox (2014) MIT Sloan Management Review, 56 (1), p. 29; Brabham, D.C., Crowdsourcing as a Model for Problem Solving: An Introduction and Cases (2008) Convergence, 14 (1), pp. 75-90; Buganza, T., Dell'Era, C., Pellizzoni, E., Trabucchi, D., Verganti, R., Unveiling the Potentialities Provided by new Technologies: A Process to Pursue Technology Epiphanies in the Smartphone app Industry (2015) Creativity and Innovation Management, 24 (3), pp. 391-414; Chesbrough, H., The Logic of Open Innovation: Managing Intellectual Property (2003) California Management Review, 45 (3), pp. 33-58; Chiesa, V., Global R&D Project Management and Organization: A Taxonomy (2000) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 17 (5), pp. 341-359; Christensen, C.M., (1997) Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Innovation and Learning: The two Faces of R and D.2 (1989) The Economic Journal, 99 (397), pp. 569-596; Cohen, W.M., Nelson, R.R., Walsh, J.P., Links and Impacts: The Influence of Public Research on Industrial R&D (2012) Management Science, 48, pp. 1-23; Cooper, R.G., Perspective Third-Generation new Product Processes (1994) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 11 (1), pp. 3-14; Cooper, R.G., Managing technology development projects (2006) Research-Technology Management, 49 (6), pp. 23-31; Cooper, R.G., Sommer, A.F., The Agile–Stage-Gate Hybrid Model: A Promising new Approach and a new Research Opportunity (2016) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 33 (5), pp. 513-526; Cozzens, S., Gatchair, S., Kang, J., Kim, K.S., Lee, H.J., Ordóñez, G., Porter, A., Emerging Technologies: Quantitative Identification and Measurement (2010) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 22 (3), pp. 361-376; Cuhls, K., From Forecasting to Foresight Processes: New Participative Foresight Activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 22 (2-3), pp. 93-111; Danneels, E., Frattini, F., Finding Applications for Technologies Beyond the Core Business (2018) MIT Sloan Management Review, 59 (3), pp. 73-78; Dell'Era, C., Altuna, N., Magistretti, S., Verganti, R., Discovering Quiescent Meanings in Technologies: Exploring the Design Management Practices That Support the Development of Technology Epiphanies (2017) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 29 (2), pp. 1-18; Dreborg, K.H., Essence of Backcasting (1996) Futures, 28 (9), pp. 813-828; Eisenhardt, K.M., Building Theories From Case Study Research (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14 (4), pp. 532-550; Eto, H., The Suitability of Technology Forecasting/Foresight Methods for Decision Systems and Strategy: A Japanese View (2003) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 70 (3), pp. 231-249; Fleming, L., Recombinant Uncertainty in Technological Search (2001) Management Science, 47 (1), pp. 117-132; Foster, R., (1986) Innovation: The Attacker’s Advantage, , New York: Summit Books; Grodal, S., Gotsopoulos, A., Suarez, F.F., The Coevolution of Technologies and Categories During Industry Emergence (2015) Academy of Management Review, 40 (3), pp. 423-445; Hegger, D.L., Van Vliet, J., Van Vliet, B.J., Niche Management and its Contribution to Regime Change: the Case of Innovation in Sanitation (2007) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 19 (6), pp. 729-746; Howe, J., (2006), http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html, The Rise of Crowdsourcing.

Originally praised as an antidote to an unsustainable market economy, there is growing concern that collaborative consumption increasingly follows a conventional market rationality of payments and profits, thereby undermining its initial social and ‘civil society’ aspects. This article investigates the future of collaborative consumption through case studies of the Peerby and MyWheels platforms, which represent new social practices of borrowing and renting. We use the sociological theories of Theodore Schatzki and Randall Collins to analyse the key factors that determine the present and future trajectories of these practices. We show how human agency and emotions in a dynamic between companies, practices, and practitioners are crucial in shaping the future of collaborative consumption. The findings suggest two diverging trajectories: one that sticks to the social aspects of connecting people through sharing things, and another that heads towards impersonal forms of collaborative consumption. The latter is primarily organized by companies, which introduce new rules (payments and insurances) and technologies (drones and autonomous vehicles) to make the shared use of things more fast, efficient, and profitable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative consumption; Practice theory; Social change","Behavioral research; Commerce; Social aspects; Autonomous Vehicles; Civil society; Collaborative consumption; Market economies; Practice theories; Social changes; Social practices; Sociological theories; Profitability",,,,,,,,,,"Belk, R., You are what you can access: sharing and collaborative consumption online (2014) J.

But newspapers have long participated in change. A constructivist approach, qualified by consideration of media materiality, draws attention to diverse but essential processes of innovation around them. We see a contraflow of migration from digital to print, opening up a shared media space; bonding strategies are bringing multimedia to ink on paper, while bridging via boundary objects such as QR (Quick Response) codes are connecting the two. Among other initiatives, development of automation of news production and experiments with transparency are further evidence of an active embrace of change by newspapers that calls into question the discourse on their demise. This analysis inductively develops a nuanced account of the role of the newspaper as an object and as an institution. It suggests a hybrid, multifaceted, enduring presence of print in the complex media ecology of the future. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.","Automation; drone; materiality; newspaper; online news; print; QR code; robot; transparency",,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.W., De Maeyer, J., Objects of journalism and the news (2015) Journalism, 16 (1), pp. 3-9; Bakardjieva, M., Rationalizing sociality: An unfinished script for socialbots (2015) The Information Society, 31, pp. 244-256; Barnhurst, K.G., (2016) Mister Pulitzer and the spider: Modern news from realism to the digital, , Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press; Barthel, M., Around half of newspaper readers rely only on print edition (2016) Pew Research Center., , http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/06/around-half-of-newspaper-readers-rely-only-on-print-edition, October; Bartlett, R., Behind the scenes at Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso (2013) journalism.co.uk, , https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/focus-on-italy-behind-the-scenes-at-gruppo-editoriale-l-espresso/s2/a554306, October; Benton, J., (2014) Warren Buffett on newspapers: “———.” NiemanLab, , http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/03/warren-buffett-on-newspapers-, December; Blair, C., CNET's plunge into print (2014) American Journalism Review, , http://ajr.org/2014/12/10/cnets-plunge-print, December; Boczkowski, P.J., The material turn in the study of journalism: Some hopeful and cautionary remarks from an early explorer (2015) Journalism, 16 (1), pp. 65-68; Bollström, R., Määttänen, A., Tobjörka, D., Ihalainen, P., Kaihovirta, N., Österbacka, R., Peltonen, J., Toivakka, M., A multilayer coated fiber-based substrate suitable for printed functionality (2009) Organic Electronics, 10, pp. 1020-1023; Borden, S.L., Tew, C., The role of journalist and the performance of journalism: Ethical lessons from “fake” news (seriously) (2007) Journal of Mass Media Ethics, 22 (4), pp. 300-314; Boyle, D., Times claims subscriber boost: ‘You can charge a premium and still increase circulation (2013) Press Gazette, , http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/times-titles-hit-350000-printonline-subscribers-you-can-charge-premium-and-still-increase, October; Brüggemann, M., Humprecht, E., Kleis Nielsen, R., Karppinen, K., Cornia, A., Esser, F., Framing the newspaper crisis (2016) Journalism Studies, 17 (5), pp. 533-551; Bruns, A., News produsage in a pro-am mediasphere: Why citizen journalism matters (2011) News online: Transformations and continuities, pp. 132-147. , Meikle G., Redden G., (eds), Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Bunz, M., New York Times publishes a daily video from its newsroom (2010) The Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/mar/23/new-york-times-timescast, November; Burrell, I., The mag trade: Net-a-Porter's new glossy magazine set to be a serious rival to Vogue (2014) The Independent, , http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/the-mag-trade-netaporters-new-glossy-magazine-set-to-be-a-serious-rival-to-vogue-9113140.html, October; Carlson, M., The robotic reporter (2015) Digital Journalism, 3, pp. 416-431; Carpignano, P., The shape of the sphere: The public sphere and the materiality of communication (1999) Constellations, 6 (2), pp. 177-189; Choi-Fitzpatrick, A., SPP Drone Lab crowd estimation methodology (2014) YouTube video., , https://youtu.be/CTH5zDJdSuk, December; Chyi, H.I., Tenenboim, O., Reality check (2016) Journalism Practice; Clark, A., Seattle mourns the last day of its venerable Post Intelligencer (2009) The Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/17/seattle-post-intelligencer-last-day, December; Coddington, M., Normalizing the hyperlink (2014) Digital Journalism, 2, pp. 140-155; Colford, P., A leap forward in quarterly earning stories.

Government authorities (such as law enforcement agencies), corporations and private individuals have identified the advantages inherent in the use of UAVs. At the same time, corporations marketing and manufacturing UAVs for civilian purposes, and the industries that support these manufacturers, have identified the enormous economic potential which may be derived from the sale and maintenance of UAVs (and the cameras and other equipment assembled into them). Hence, in the coming years, we will undoubtedly witness a rapid expansion of the civilian use of UAVs. Given the assumption that the entry of UAVs into the civilian market is a certainty, what are the possible implications for the fundamental right to privacy, and does the issue of permits for civilian uses of UAVs indicate that privacy protection laws are now irrelevant? In answering these questions, the article deals with five problems. The first problem relates to the fact that, although it is a fundamental right, the right to privacy is vague; there is an essential difficulty in defining privacy and the situations in which it applies, including situations that involve the use of UAVs. The second problem focuses on finding a balance between the advantages inherent in the civilian use of UAVs and possible harm to the right to privacy and other fundamental rights such as freedom of expression. As the article will describe in detail, it is not possible to determine, a priori, whether the advantages of using UAVs outweigh their disadvantages, or vice versa. The third problem arises from the possibility of restricting the use of UAVs, either at the data collection stage, or, alternatively, at the stage at which the data is used. As shall be explained, this is a moral question, the answer to which varies from one legal system to another. The fourth problem concerns the choice of Israeli law as the basis for examining whether the law can provide suitable tools to deal with the risks involved in the use of UAVs. In this context, it should be noted that although Israel is considered a leading manufacturer of UAVs, Israeli law is unique, inter alia, in light of the fact that the Israeli legal system combines elements of both common law and continental law, and the fact that regulation of the use of UAVs in Israel is in its infancy. The fifth problem arises from the element of uncertainty. Given that the existing system of laws does not provide a sufficient response to a possible threat to fundamental rights (in the instance discussed in the article, the threat which UAVs pose to the right to privacy), how should the legislature regulate the use of UAVs, without harming the delicate balance between the advantages and disadvantages inherent in their use. The article focuses on Israel as a case study and also comprehensively examines the solutions to the problems described above, as adopted in the United States and Europe. © 2014 Xamax Consultancy Pty Ltd.

The proposed controller is applied to the inner and outer loop for heading and position trajectory tracking control to handle the external disturbances caused by the variation in the payload weight during the flight period.

The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to demonstrate how LE-RPAS could be used to improve the logistic response to a rapid onset disaster. Design/methodology/approach: Using the response to the Cyclone Pam that struck Vanuatu in March 2015 as an example, this paper provides an overview of how LE-RPAS could be used to support the post-disaster needs assessment and subsequent response processes. In addition, it provides a high-level route map to develop the people, process and technology requirements that would support the operational deployment of the LE-RPAS capabilities. Findings: On the basis of the analysis of the published literature and the resultant assessment of the benefits of LE-RPAS to support humanitarian logistic (HL) operations, it is concluded that a formal “proof of concept” trial should be undertaken, and the results be made available to the humanitarian community. Research limitations/implications: This paper is conceptual in nature, but has been developed through an analysis of the literature relating to remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) and HLs. A route map through which the paper’s conclusions can be validated is also offered. Practical implications: LE-RPAS have great potential to provide a swifter understanding of the impact of a disaster, particularly those where the location is remote from the main centres of population. This would allow the affected country’s National Disaster Management Organisation, together with those of supporting countries, to react more efficiently and effectively. In particular, it would allow a swifter transition from a “guess-based” push approach to one that more accurately reflects the disaster’s impact – i.e. a pull-based logistic response. Social implications: Given the military genesis of RPAS, it will be important to ensure that those engaged in their operation are sensitive to the implications of this. In particular, it will be essential to ensure that any humanitarian operations involving RPAS are undertaken in an ethical way that respects, for example, the privacy and safety of the affected population. Originality/value: While there is some emerging discussion on the humanitarian-related use of RPAS in the literature, this generally reflects the operation of small aircraft with limited range and payload capabilities. Useful though such RPAS unquestionably are, this paper expands the discussion of how such systems can support the humanitarian logistician by considering the benefits and challenges of operating long-endurance aircraft. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Drone;

Three metaphors are used to frame, track and analyse recent research and commentary in the area - these are clones, drones and dragons. Although development mechanisms rarely fall neatly within one category, the metaphors provide a useful way to examine some of the ongoing uncertainties around leader development. Clones duplicate what others think they know about successful leadership. Drones carry cloned knowledge and are controlled from afar by centralised authorities or other outsiders. Dragons take organic forms which can mutate in terms of shape, colour and form in line with more localised needs. As such, they aim to nurture leaders who lead change successfully within their communities with reference to but not dictated by standardised knowledge. Issues flowing from interactions between these categories form a set of questions or tensions faced by systems and leaders themselves. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","leader development; metaphors; principals; schools; uncertainty",,,,,,,,,,,"(2014) Asian Dragons, , http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/mythic-creatures/dragons-creatures-of-power/asian-dragons, Accessed April 25.

Morphological analysis is one appropriate method given its objective, impersonal, and systematic nature. However, how to build a morphological matrix is a critical problem, especially in the big data era. This research focuses on Wikipedia's case-specific characteristics and well-coordinated knowledge structure and attempts to integrate the platform with morphological analysis. In details, several methodological options are explored to implement Wikipedia data into morphological analysis. We then propose a Wikipedia-based approach to the development of morphological matrix, which incorporates the data on table of contents, hyperlinks, and categories. Its feasibility was demonstrated through a case study of drone technology, and its validity and effectiveness was shown based on a comparative analysis with a conventional discussion-based approach. The methodology is expected to be served as an essential supporting tool for generating creative ideas that could spark innovation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Idea generation; Ideation; Morphological analysis; Wikipedia","Hypertext systems; Linguistics; Matrix algebra; Morphology; Websites; Comparative analysis; Critical problems; Idea generation; Ideation; Knowledge structures; Morphological analysis; Morphological matrixes; Wikipedia; Big data; data processing; morphology; World Wide Web",,,,,"NRF-2017R1E1A1A01077324

However, the use of UAS technology, in general, and within the particular context of domestic policing activities raises serious concerns about personal privacy and the greater intrusion of new forms of 'big brother' surveillance in people's daily lives. On the basis of a national survey, the current study provides empirical evidence on public attitudes about UAS usage in various policing activities. Socio-demographic differences in the public support for drone usage in this context are also examined. Our general findings of context-specific variability in public support for UAS usage in policing operations are discussed in terms of their implications for developing public policy. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Drones; Policing; Privacy; Surveillance; UAS",,,,,,,,,,,"(2013) The Economic Impact of Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration in the Unites States, , http://www.auvsi.org/auvsiresources/economicreport, Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI)., March, accessed 15 May 2015; Balcerzak, A., Hiegel, T., (2013) Police Forces Struggle to Incorporate Drone, , http://droneproject.nationalsecurityzone.org/headline-police-forces-struggle-to-incorporate-drones-ashley-balcerzak-and-taylor-hiegel/, Medill National Security Zone, 18 March, accessed 15 May 2015; Brown, A., Newport, F., (2013) U.S., 65% Support Drone Attacks on Terrorists Abroad, , http://www.gallup.com/poll/161474/support-drone-attacks-terrorists-abroad.aspx, Gallup, 25 March, accessed 15 May 2015; Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., Gosling, S.D., Amazon's Mechanical Turk a new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?

This research introduces a new routing model that considers a synchronized truck-drone operation by allowing multiple drones to fly from a truck, serve one or multiple customers, and return to the same truck for a battery swap and package retrieval. The model addresses two levels (echelons) of delivery: primary truck routing from the main depot to serve assigned customers and secondary drone routing from the truck, which behaves like a moveable intermediate depot to serve other sets of customers. The model takes into account both trucks' and drones’ capacities with the objective of finding optimal routes of both trucks and drones that minimizes the total arrival time of both trucks and drones at the depot after completing the deliveries. The problem can be solved by formulated mixed integer programming (MIP) for the small-size problem, and two efficient heuristic algorithms are designed to solve the large-size problems: Drone Truck Route Construction (DTRC) and Large Neighborhood Search (LNS). Numeric results from the experiment compare the performance of both heuristics against the MIP method in small/medium-size instances from the literature. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to show the delivery time improvement of the proposed model over the previous truck-drone routing models. © 2019","Drone delivery; Heuristic; Optimization; Routing; Routing problem; Two-echelon; Vehicle","Automobiles; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Optimization; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Trucks; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Heuristic; Large neighborhood search; Mixed integer programming (MIP); Routing; Routing and scheduling; Routing problems; Two-echelon; Vehicle Routing Problems; Drones",,,,,,,,,,"Agatz, N., Bouman, P., Schmidt, M., Optimization approaches for the traveling salesman problem with drone (2018) Transp.

Notably, logistic companies have given close attention to these vehicles to reduce delivery time and operational cost. A variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem, was introduced involving drone-assisted parcel delivery. The drone launches from the truck, proceeds to deliver parcels to a customer, and then is recovered by the truck at a third location. While the drone travels through a trip, the truck delivers parcels to other customers as long as the drone has enough battery to hover waiting for the truck. This work proposes a hybrid heuristic where the initial solution is created from the optimal TSP solution reached by a TSP solver. Next, an implementation of the general variable neighborhood search is employed to obtain the delivery routes of truck and drone. Computational experiments show the potential of the algorithm to improve significantly delivery time. Furthermore, we provide a new set of instances based on the well-known traveling salesman problem library instances. © 2019 The Authors.

Video Analysis tasks are crucial for the target tracking and recognition; anyway, it would be desirable if a further level of understanding could provide a comprehensive, high-level scene description, by reflecting that human cognitive capability of providing a concise scene description that comes from the analysis of involved objects relationships and actions. This paper presents a smart system to identify mobile scene objects, such as people, vehicles, automatically, by analyzing the videos acquired by drones in flight, along with the activities they carried out, so as to depict what it happens in the scene from a high-level perspective. The system uses Artificial Vision methods to detect and track the mobile objects and the area where they move, and Semantic Web technologies to provide a high-level description of the scenario. Spatio/temporal relations among the tracked objects as well as simple object activities (events)are described. By semantic reasoning, the system is able to connect the simple activities into more complex activities, that better reflect a human-like description of a scenario portion. Tests conducted on several videos, showing scenarios set in different environments, return convincing results which affirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Activity composition; Activity detection; Object classification; OWL; Semantic Web technologies; Video tracking","Image segmentation; Semantic Web; Target tracking; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Video recording; Activity detection; Cognitive capability; High level description; Monitoring activities; Object classification; Semantic Web technology; Video tracking; Video-content analysis; Security systems",,,,,,,,,,"(2018), https://technology.ihs.com/571965/top-video-surveillance-trends-for-2016, IHS, Top Video Surveillance Trends for 2016, Online; accessed 9 September; (2018), https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/technology-driving-innovation/drones/, Goldman Sachs, Drones.

We proposed an approach, according to which the method for modeling the structure of complex technical systems is applied to describe the behavior of unmanned vehicles' formation. The changes in topology and in the covered area as a result of unmanned vehicles' rearrangement within a formation were considered. Based on the result of present study, a method for determining the area of unmanned vehicles' formation operation involving the graph theory was proposed. Formation of the loaded directed graphs that correspond to the main (star, ring, bus) and mixed (hierarchical star with a bus, hierarchical star with a ring) formation topologies was considered in detail. The adjacency matrix and the loading matrix for the topology ""hierarchical star"" were analyzed. In addition, the study conducted allows us to conclude that to ensure a full coverage of a certain territory, the mathematical model of the structure of a dynamic system must be characterized by a random number of vertices that correspond to a variable number of unmanned vehicle in a formation. Various technical characteristics of unmanned vehicles, which belong to different classes by weight or control type, must be considered into account when constructing the matrix of graph loading. Calculation of the area, covered by an unmanned vehicles' formation, is performed as calculation of the area of polygons, assigned by their vertices, using the interpolation concept to count the intermediate values of magnitudes by a discrete set of known coordinate values. Calculation of the formation area is based on the ranges, within which sustainable communication between the drones of different models is provided. Partition of the loading matrix into subordination units makes it possible to decrease computational complexity and thereby prolong operation of a formation. Application of this approach will allow us to plan more effectively the time and the number of drones in a formation, necessary for covering the territory of the specified size. © I. Zhuravska, I.

These laws and the general context in which they operate will be explained, with appropriate comparisons made to the European Union frameworks. In order to examine their specific application vis-à-vis automated technologies, three case studies – automated facial recognition technologies (AFRT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs – better known as ‘drones’) and autonomous vehicles (or ‘driverless cars’) – are selected to examine the extent to which existing privacy and data protection laws, and their application, can be considered adequate to address privacy and data protection risks that these technologies bring. These case studies evidence existing deficiencies with privacy protection in Australia and the inadequacy of recent reform processes, demonstrating that Australian data privacy laws are not well placed to protect individuals' rights vis-à-vis automated technologies. © 2017 Angela Daly","Australia; Data protection; Driverless cars; Drones; Facial recognition; Privacy","Automation; Drones; Face recognition; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Australia; Automated technology; Autonomous Vehicles; Data protection laws; Driverless cars; European union; Facial recognition; Privacy protection; Data privacy",,,,,,,,,,,"Daly, A.; QUT Faculty of Law, Queensland University of Technology, GPO Box 2434, Australia; email: Angela.daly@qut.edu.au",,,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,02673649,,CLSRE,,"English","Comput Law Secur.

This progress significantly impacts production forces. This paper analyzes theoretical and applied approaches to the investigation of production forces development. I reveal the role and importance of innovations in science and technology as well as their impact on various segments of the economy. I analyze the conceptual framework used for technological shifts. The paper describes the indicators showing the level of scientific and technological potential development in various countries and regions including the Urals. I define growth areas in technology and assess their contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The administrations and authorities at federal and regional levels impact the development of science, innovations, technologies and breakthrough areas. The development of these spheres leads to the increase in productivity of social activities, production and business activity. The paper reveals the impact of the technological breakthrough in such latest fields as the alternative energy sources, drones, electric car industry, storage and delivery of energy. This fields transform the economy and society. Furthermore, they change theoretical concepts of functional and institutional social structure. The development paradigm is to be modified from fuel and raw model to the innovative and technological one. The economic development and scientific and technological potential are interrelated. I discuss the reason of close attention to the development of science, technologies, innovations in the developed countries. as well as the measures to stimulate their development. The article studies the mechanism and tools of science and education funding in various regions of the world. The results of the research may be used for updating the strategy of scientific and technological development of Russia and its regions in the current situation as well as for choosing necessary conceptual approaches to the development of the economy.","Foreign countries; Industrial society; Research and development; Russia; Scientific and technological potential; Technological innovations; Technology; The Urals; «digitalization»",,,,,,"Russian Humanitarian Foundation: № 15–02–00587а","The article has been supported by the Russian Foundation for Humanities (project № 15–02–00587а).",,,,"Bell, D., (1999) Gryadushcheye Postindustrialnoye Obshchestvo.

Short term and long term forecasts show extensive utilization of drones in various sectors. Yet, it is uncertain if general public accepts this highly potential drone congestion. This quantitative survey study explored public acceptance of drones by using the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) model and using statistical analysis to decrease the uncertainty. The KAP model was utilized in a recent survey study to understand the public opinion of drones. This survey instrument was thoroughly redesigned to better understand general public's knowledge and attitudes of forty different drone applications, and associated risk perceptions. The practice section was redesigned as well to better understand how public uses drones personally and on company level. The results showed that drones were not well accepted at present except for public safety and scientific research applications. Commercial and hobby uses are not supported. Public sees the drones as a risky technology that directly interferes with their privacy. Moreover, public is not aware of most of the future drone applications, and many current applications. The survey was distributed to both general public and stakeholders to represent both part of the society (153 fully completed surveys). A qualitative risk analysis was conducted in this study as well. By considering the results, this study recommends that public and private institutions should collaborate to develop risk mitigation and response strategies to minimize the risks. Also, public needs to get informed on these strategies through mass media and educational institutions. This might help improving the reputation of drones from killer machines or privacy interrupters towards a technology that helps our society. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Drones; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Social aspects; Surveys; Uncertainty analysis; Educational institutions; Private institutions; Public acceptance; Qualitative risk analysis; Response strategies; Scientific researches; Short-term and long-term forecasts; Survey instruments; Public risks; aerial survey; qualitative analysis; risk perception; technology adoption; uncertainty analysis; unmanned vehicle",,,,,,,,,,"Rosal, V.D., Disruption, Emerging Technologies and the Future of Work (2015), first ed.

Specifically, we look at the emergence of drones and the evolving regulation of their ownership and use. We present a qualitative, thematic analysis of city council meetings in 20 cities in southern California where drone regulation was discussed from 2014 to 2017. These results show the ethical themes that were operative in such discussions: privacy, safety, enforceability, crime, nuisance and professionality. Underlying most of these themes is trust. We discuss this concept with respect to the good society, and we suggest that trust may be more critical to emerging technologies than technologies in general. That is, trust in an emerging technology is required for it to be accepted and more fully integrated in society. Without trust, it is difficult for society to accept the technology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Drones; Emerging technologies; Information ethics; Policy; Regulation","Philosophical aspects; Public policy; City council; Emerging technologies; Ethical values; Fully integrated; Information ethics; Regulation; Southern California; Thematic analysis; Drones; governance approach; information technology; regulatory framework; technology policy; California; United States",,,,,,,,,,"Jonas, H., The Imperative of Responsibility: in Search of an Ethics for the Technological Age (1985), University of Chicago press; Paulo, N., The Confluence of Philosophy and Law in Applied Ethics (2016), Springer; Brey, P., The strategic role of technology in a good society (2018) Technol.

The maximum travel distance of drones without a need to recharge is limited by their endurance. Recharge stations can be used to extend the coverage area of the drones. The purpose of this paper is to find the best topology for both relief centers and recharge stations to cover a large-scale area with minimum and feasible incurred costs and waiting times. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-level facility location problem (FLP) is utilized to find the optimum number of relief centers and refuel stations and their locations. It is supposed that the demand occurs according to Poisson distribution. The allocation of the demand is based on nearest neighborhood method. A hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the model. The performance of the algorithm is examined through a case study. Findings: The proposed method delivers increased efficiency and responsiveness of the humanitarian relief system. The coverage area of the drones is extended by refuel stations, total costs of the system are reduced and the time to respond an emergency, which is an important factor in survival rate, is significantly decreased.

Even though different types of technology might be effective in the context of crime prevention, investigation or prosecution (whether national or transnational) and victim protection, such processes inevitably raise significant concerns particularly in relation to privacy and data protection. This article aims to offer an introduction to these challenges in order to trigger a much-needed dialogue in this regard. After outlining key terms and main provisions concerning privacy and data protection, the present article then explores three ways in which technological developments can contribute to combatting human trafficking - location tracking, data collection and drones -, through these it highlights the respective privacy and data protection concerns and attempts to offer ways forward. © 2015 Felicity Gerry, Julia Muraszkiewicz & Niovi Vavoula.

Local governments struggle to provide adequate public services under budgetary constraints and vast spatial and economic inequalities. After the demise of the centralized modernist planning paradigm, current approaches to urban development focus on public-private partnerships, resulting in networks of dependency that involve multiple stakeholders and complex relationships of accountability. This stakeholder complexity complicates decision making, but can also lead to new social practices and participatory models of infrastructure governance. This paper presents the results of a qualitative study of social practices surrounding the provision and modernization of streetlight and electricity in Paco, Manila, enacted by formal and informal actors. Drawing from the case study, literature on organizational improvisation and improvisational governance (Martijn Hartog, 2015), we propose a model of infrastructure governance that is based on the concept of improvisation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with city officials, planners, residents and local activists, we develop the notion of improstructure as a conceptual model for understanding infrastructure governance as an improvisational process of “call and response” among a diverse set of actors. We apply this perspective to ongoing modernization efforts by the city of Manila and its utility companies, involving smart city technologies including sensor networks, drone mapping, and data analytics. We argue that despite the placeless and generic rhetoric surrounding these technologies, they constitute improvisational responses to local conditions. We conclude by formulating design principles for improvisational infrastructure governance, which are not limited to the Global South, but also apply in developed countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"centralization; decision making; developing world; governance approach; infrastructure planning; modernization; public service; stakeholder; urban development",,,,,,"This work was supported by an internal grant by the first author's university.

Due to high cost of top-end drones and requirements for secure landing, development of reliable drone recovery systems is a hot topic now. In this paper, we describe the development of a parachute system with fall detection based on accelerometer-gyroscope MPU - 6050 and fall detection algorithm based on the Kalman filter to reduce acceleration errors while drone is flying. We developed the compensation algorithm for temperature-related accelerometer errors. The parachute system tests were performed from a small height on a soft surface. Later, the system was tested under real-world conditions. The system functioned effectively, resulting in parachute activation times of less than 0.5s. We also discuss the civilian and military applications of the developed recovery system in harsh (high temperature) environment. © 2018 Basem AL-Madani et al.",,"Accelerometers; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Drones; High temperature applications; Parachutes; Activation time; Compensation algorithm; Fall detection; High temperature; Parachute system; Recovery systems; Soft surface; Temperature compensation; Military applications",,,,,"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, KFUPM","The authors acknowledge the support by King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM) in publishing this work.",,,,"Barmpounakis, E.N., Vlahogianni, E.I., Golias, J.C., Unmanned Aerial Aircraft Systems for transportation engineering: Current practice and future challenges (2016) International Journal of Transportation Science and Technology, 5 (3), pp. 111-122; Poh, C.-H., Poh, C.-K., RadioControlled ""3DAerobaticAirplanes"" as Basis for Fixed-Wing UAVs with VTOL Capability (2014) Open Journal of Applied Sciences, 4 (12), pp. 515-521; D'Oleire-Oltmanns, S., Marzolff, I., Peter, K.D., Ries, J.B., Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for monitoring soil erosion inMorocco (2012) Remote Sensing, 4 (11), pp. 3390-3416; Goebel, M.E., Perryman, W.L., Hinke, J.T., A small unmanned aerial system for estimating abundance and size of Antarctic predators (2015) Polar Biology, 38 (5), pp. 619-630; Whitehead, K., Hugenholtz, C.H., Remote sensing of the environment with small unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), part 1: A review of progress and challenges (2014) Journal of Unmanned Vehicle Systems, 2, p. 69; Cuesta, F., Lopez-Rodriguez, F., Esteban, A., ANewBlondin System for Surveying and Photogrammetry (2013) Sensors, 13 (12), pp. 16894-16914; Honkavaara, E., Saari, H., Kaivosoja, J., Processing and assessment of spectrometric, stereoscopic imagery collected using a lightweight UAV spectral camera for precision agriculture (2013) Remote Sensing, 5 (10), pp. 5006-5039; Xu, Z., Yang, J., Peng, C., Development of an UAS for post-earthquake disaster surveying and its application inMs7.0 Lushan Earthquake, Sichuan, China (2014) Computers &geosciences, 68, p. 22; Tang, L., Shao, G., Drone remote sensing for forestry research and practices (2015) Journal of Forestry Research, 26 (4), pp. 791-797; Zhao, Z., Pu, X., Du, C., Freestanding Flag-Type Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Harvesting High-AltitudeWind Energy from Arbitrary Directions (2016) ACS Nano, 10 (2), pp. 1780-1787; Mustaffa, A.A., Hasmori, M.F., Sarif, A.S., Ahmad, N.F., Zainun, N.Y., TheUse ofUAVinHousing Renovation Identification: A Case Study at Taman Manis 2 (2018) IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 140, p. 012003; Whitehead, K., Hugenholtz, C.H., Myshak, S., Remote sensing of the environment with small unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), part 2: Scientific and commercial applications (2014) Journal of UnmannedVehicle Systems, 2 (3), pp. 86-102; Paucar, C., Morales, L., Pinto, K., Use of drones for surveillance and reconnaissance of military areas (2018) Developments and Advances in Defense and Security.

Further, with the prominence of personalization and customer engagement as the go-to customer management strategies, it is essential for firms to understand how to integrate new-age technologies into their existing practices to aid seamlessly in the generation of actionable insights. Towards this end, this study proposes an organizing framework to understand how firms can use digital analytics, within the changing technology landscape, to generate consumer insights. The proposed framework begins by recognizing the forces that are external to the firm then lead to the generation of specific capabilities by the firm. Further, the firms capabilities can lead to the generation of insights for decision-making that can be data-driven and/or analytics-driven. Finally, the proposed framework identifies the creation of value-based outcomes for firms and customers resulting from the insights generated. Additionally, we identify moderators that influence: (a) the impact of external forces on the development of firm capabilities, and (b) the creation of insights and subsequent firm outcomes. This study also identifies questions for future research that combines the inclusion of new-age technologies, generation of strategic insights, and the achievement of established firm outcomes. © 2020 Marketing EDGE.org.","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Digital analytics; Drones; Firm capabilities; Internet of things",,,,,,,"We thank the Guest Editors of the special issue, and the reviewers for their valuable feedback during the revision process.

The potential use of drones to study public gatherings or other human activities raises novel issues of privacy, confidentiality, and consent, which this article explores in depth. It argues that drone research could fall into several different categories: non-human subjects research (HSR), exempt HSR, or non-exempt HSR. In the case of non-exempt HSR, it will be difficult for institutional review boards to approve studies unless they are designed so that informed consent can be waived. Whether drone research is non-HSR, exempt HSR, or non-exempt HSR, it is important for investigators to consult communities which could be affected by the research. © 2018, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Confidentiality; Consent; Drones; Ethics; Privacy; Regulation; Research","aircraft; confidentiality; demography; ethics; health survey; human; information processing; informed consent; legislation and jurisprudence; privacy; professional standard; research ethics; research subject; Aircraft; Confidentiality; Data Collection; Ethics Committees, Research; Ethics, Research; Humans; Informed Consent; Population Surveillance; Privacy; Research Subjects; Residence Characteristics",,,,,"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS

Critics expressed fears regarding their threat to privacy and safety, and legislatures considered numerous bills that would significantly limit or even ban domestic unmanned flight. UAV advocates used various methods to counter UAV's negative image. This study examines media stories regarding UAVs over a four-year period (2011-2014) and demonstrates that despite the backlash against expansion, media frames emphasizing benefit rather than risk dominated in the U.S. media. The economic opportunities presented by UAVs appeared in most media reports and over time reports increased of relatively noncontroversial applications, such as agriculture. Citizen advocacy or frames that emphasized the personal freedom to fly a UAV also increased. Industry and university officials, who usually support expansion, were the most frequent sponsors of media statements. The framing of media reports can influence public debate. Potential risks of a new technology can be amplified or minimized depending on how the media present the issue to the public. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Drones; FAA; Media framing; UAV","Public risks; Receiving antennas; Domestic airspace; Drones; Economic opportunities; FAA; Media framing; Negative image; Potential risks; United States of America; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); mass media; media role; policy implementation; policy reform; unmanned vehicle; United States",,,,,"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA: TN00459","This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture , Hatch Project TN00459 .

The complementary capabilities of the drone and the truck pose an innovative delivery mode. The relevant optimisation problem associated with this new mode, known as the travelling salesman problem with drone (TSP-D), aims to find the coordinated routes of a drone and a truck to serve a list of customers. In practice, managers sometimes intend to attain a compromise between operational cost and completion time. Therefore, this article addresses a bi-objective TSP-D considering both objectives. An improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (INSGA-II) is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, the label algorithm-based decoding method, the fast non-dominated sorting approach, the crowding-distance computation procedure, and the local search component are devised to accommodate the features of the problem. Furthermore, the first Pareto front obtained by the INSGA-II is improved by a post-optimisation component. Computational results validate the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm. Meanwhile, the trade-off analysis demonstrates the relationship between operational cost and completion time and provides managerial insights for managers designing reasonable compromise routes. © Operational Research Society 2019.","drone-assisted delivery; Logistics; metaheuristics; multi-objective optimisation; travelling salesman problem","Cost benefit analysis; Drones; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Logistics; Managers; Multiobjective optimization; Trucks; Competitive performance; Computational results; Meta heuristics; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Non-dominated Sorting; Optimisation problems; Trade-off analysis; Travelling salesman problem; Traveling salesman problem",,,,,"2018ldbryb015

In particular, this study examined how four subdimensions of INELOC, namely, green consumers, activists, advocates, and recyclers, affect anticipated emotions, such as positive and negative anticipated emotions. In addition, the effects of positive and negative anticipated emotions on intention to use were proposed. A research model with 10 hypotheses was developed and tested on the basis of theoretical relationships using 324 samples collected in South Korea. Data analysis results indicated that all four subdimensions of INELOC significantly affect positive anticipated emotions. Meanwhile, only green consumers and advocates significantly affect negative anticipated emotions. Lastly, significant relationships were found between anticipated emotions and intention to use. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anticipated emotions; Behavioral intention; Drone food delivery services; Eco-friendly; Internal environmental locus of control",,,,,,,,,,,"Agresti, A., Finlay, B., (2009) Statistical methods for the social sciences, , 4th ed., Pearson Prentice Hall; Aguilar, O.M., Waliczek, T.M., Zajicek, J.M., Growing environmental stewards: The overall effect of a school gardening program on environmental attitudes and environmental locus of control of different demographic groups of elementary school children (2008) HortTechnology, 18 (2), pp. 243-249; Ahn, J., Kwon, J., Green hotel brands in Malaysia: perceived value, cost, anticipated emotion, and revisit intention (2020) Current Issues in Tourism, 23 (12), pp. 1559-1516; Bagozzi, R.P., Belanche, D., Casaló, L.V., Flavián, C., The role of anticipated emotions in purchase intentions (2016) Psychology & Marketing, 33 (8), pp. 629-645; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16 (1), pp. 74-94; Bamburry, D., Drones: Designed for product delivery (2015) Design Management Review, 26 (1), pp. 40-48; Baumgartner, H., Pieters, R., Bagozzi, R.P., Future‐oriented emotions: Conceptualization and behavioral effects (2008) European Journal of Social Psychology, 38 (4), pp. 685-696; Bohlen, G., Schlegelmilch, B.B., Diamantopoulos, A., Measuring ecological concern: A multi‐construct perspective (1993) Journal of Marketing Management, 9 (4), pp. 415-430; Bradley, G.L., Sparks, B.A., Service locus of control: Its conceptualization and measurement (2002) Journal of Service Research, 4 (4), pp. 312-324; (2018), https://www.cbsnews.com/news/winter-olympics-in-pyeongchang-are-the-highest-tech-games-yet/, February 15).

The drawback of UAVs is the fight-time due to the limited battery capacity. Therefore, energy harvesting (EH), captured energy from the ambient environment is one of the effective measures to prolong the flight time for UAVs. This paper proposes the hybrid EH system, which can simultaneously harvest power from solar and radio frequency (RF) energy sources to significantly improve the energy issues for endurance longer flight UAVs. A 7-stage voltage multiplier circuit of the stand-alone RF-EH system is designed and simulated in this work. The stand-alone solar harvester is a solar panel. The DC output voltage from both of two energy sources is passed through a DC-DC boost converter and stabilizer. Simulation results can be deployed to power for the battery of UAVs in practice. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Rogers suggest to develop human centric “ Ubiquitous Computing ” solution, for specific domain (agriculture production). Crop yield prediction (CYP) is vital to address the ever growing demand of food requirements of burgeoning world population and to prevent starvation. Artificial Intelligence can offer effective and practical solution for the problem. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL) have been evaluated. Machine Learning models (using python, R, Seaborn) have been experimented in this paper. Data of crop yield is used for model evaluation, which includes horticultural product (Banana), cash crop (Sugarcane), food crop (Rice), for kharif, rabi season (Dataset of Tamil Nadu and US region); Future research could combine remote sensing data and machine learning to predict the yield (using google earth engine). Better accuracy in crop prediction is possible when vital data like soil moisture content (ground level, root level and extreme ends of the field), 14 micro nutrients of soil is made available, for many seasons. ©BEIESP.","AI 2.0; Cyber Physical System (CPS); CYP; Drones (UAV); Floccinaucinihilipilification; LSTM; Machine Learning (Python, R, Seaborn Plotting (Python visualization package)); STARMAC Quadrator helicopter UAV; SVM; Trans Disciplinary Approach",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

In fact, drone delivery is already improving logistics service in many countries. There are, however, unaddressed nuances when comparing drones with surface vehicles. An assumption often made is that delivery time is independent of delivery processes that are not typically associated with drive time, such as loading. This can be acceptable for comparing alternate types of surface delivery vehicles, but not when comparing surface delivery vehicles with drones. To address this issue, empirical store-to-consumer deliveries are collected from a retail establishment in the United States and used to design and calibrate a discrete event simulation model to match the retailer's delivery process. Using this model, drones are compared with surface vehicles under alternate changes of state. The model is given a range of post hoc tests to further define the dimensions of the model and to generalize it for research applications in multiple contexts. © 1973-2011 IEEE.","Discrete event simulation; drone; last-mile delivery; order fulfillment; parcel delivery; retail; systems theory; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).","Drones; Sales; System theory; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Discrete-event simulation model; Innovative solutions; Last mile; Order fulfillment; Parcel delivery; Research applications; retail; Simulation-based process model; Discrete event simulation",,,,,,,,,,"Agatz, N., Bouman, P., Schmidt, M., Optimization approaches for the traveling salesman problem with drone (2018) Transportation Science, 52 (4), pp. 739-1034; Barbarosoglu, G., Ozdamar, L., Cevik, A., An interactive approach for hierarchical analysis of helicopter logistics in disaster relief operations (2002) European Journal of Operational Research, 140 (1), pp. 118-133; Boscoe, F.P., Henry, K.A., Zdeb, M.S., A nationwide comparison of driving distance versus straight-line distance to hospitals (2012) The Professional Geographer, 64 (2), pp. 188-196; Bottani, E., Montanari, R., Supply chain design and cost analysis through simulation (2010) International Journal of Production Research, 48 (10), pp. 2859-2886; Chen, C., Crowddeliver: Planning city-wide package delivery paths leveraging the crowd of taxis (2017) IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 18 (6), pp. 1478-1496; Closs, D.J., Nyaga, G.N., Voss, M.D., The differential impact of product complexity, inventory level, and configuration capacity on unit and order fill rate performance (2010) Journal of Operations Management, 28 (1), pp. 47-57; Davis, J.P., Eisenhardt, K.M., Bingham, C.B., Developing theory through simulation methods (2007) Academy of Management Review, 32 (2), pp. 480-499; Diaz, M.A., Hendey, G.W., Bivins, H.G., When is the helicopter faster?

Moreover, research on consumer perceptions regarding commercial drones in Pakistan and around the world is very sparse. The purpose of this paper is to gauge the level of acceptability and concerns Pakistani consumers may have in accepting the drone delivery technology. This study offers new insights that retailers and delivery companies can use to penetrate target markets in early stages. The authors have executed a quantitative analysis through the means of a survey. A sample of middle- and upper class residents of two cities in Pakistan was selected on which purposive sampling technique was applied. A total of 307 responses were collected and these responses were analysed in SPSS. Various analysis techniques were applied including Cronbach’s alpha, the Pearson correlation analysis, regression analysis and cluster analysis. The results show that consumers in Pakistan perceive privacy issues as a primary concern in relation to drone delivery. The results also throw light on the profile of consumer segments that can be targeted by retailers who may desire to use the drone delivery technology in the near future. Using these findings, retailers using the drone delivery mechanism can address consumer’s fears and ambiguities. Retailers can resolve consumer concerns by designing pro-privacy parameters in the initial service design stage and the infrastructure deployment of drones. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","commercial drones; consumer acceptance; consumer concerns; delivery drones; environmental concerns; Pakistan; privacy concerns; retailers; safety concerns",,,,,,,,,,,"Afshan, S., Sharif, A., Acceptance of mobile banking framework in Pakistan (2016) Telematics and Informatics, 33 (2), pp. 370-387. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2015.09.005; Ahmad, J., (2015) The encouraging future of e-commerce in Pakistan, , https://tribune.com.pk/story/975430/the-encouraging-future-of-e-commerce-in-pakistan/, [online] The Express Tribune.

No. 2, Warsaw, 00-908, Poland","Currently, almost unrestricted access to low-lying areas of airspace creates an opportunity to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially those capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), in transport services. UAVs become increasingly popular for transporting postal items over small, medium, and large distances. It is forecasted that, in the near future, VTOL UAVs with a high take-offweightwill also deliver goods to very distant and hard-to-reach locations. Therefore,UAVnavigation plays a very important role in the process of carrying out transport services. At present, during the flight phase, drones make use of the integrated global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and the inertial navigation system (INS). However, the inaccuracy of GNSS + INS makes it unsuitable for landing and take-off, necessitating the guidance of a human UAV operator during those phases. Available navigation systems do not provide sufficiently high positioning accuracy for an UAV. For this reason, full automation of the landing approach is not possible. This paper puts forward a proposal to solve this problem.The authors show the structure of an autonomous system and a Doppler-based navigation procedure that allows for automatic landing approaches. An accuracy evaluation of the developed solution for VTOL is made on the basis of simulation studies. © 2017 Jan M.

Progress on two aspects is presented, on one hand, technology development, and on the other hand, dealing with the emerging risks associated with these new technologies. Technology development covers three functions assembled in a workflow: • Image collection via a light drone with an autonomous navigation system and image geographical positioning system (GPS) referencing capabilities. • Image automated pre-processing: image assembly and georeferencing. • Threat detection: image analysis by change detection is performed using Definiens software for identifying external interferences like construction work and excavations threatening the pipeline. This set of technologies is perceived as an emerging risk that is appraised from several points of view: • Technology: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), image georeferencing and assembly, change detection for threat identification. • Human and Organisational and Communication: investigate the acceptance of this technology by the population and local authorities. • Regulatory: check conditions that will ensure acceptance of operational use of light drones in some European countries. • This general approach is needed to ensure both technology optimisation and the shortest path to reliable practical applications. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","automated aerial sureveillance; automated image processing; drone; energy transmission pipeline; external interference; gas transmission pipeline; ground observation; industrial safety; key performance indicators; pipeline safety","automated aerial sureveillance; Automated image processing; drone; Energy transmission; External interference; Gas transmission pipeline; Ground observations; Key performance indicators; Pipeline safety; Accident prevention; Automation; Benchmarking; Gas pipelines; Industrial applications; Monitoring; Natural gas pipelines; Natural gas transportation; Navigation systems; Risk management; Signal detection; Target drones; Technology; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Image processing",,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 213345",,,,,"Baatz, M., Hoffmann, C., Willhauck, G., Definiens, A.G., Progressing from object-based to object-oriented image analysis (2008) Object-based Image Analysis: Spatial Concepts for Knowledge-driven Remote Sensing Applications, , Edited by: Blaschke, T.

The nearly 1-lb Wasp III carries all the sensors found on high-end airplanes, including an altimeter, GPS-based navigation, accelerometers, and magnetometer. The most important onboard component, the payload, consists of either a pod with forward and side looking electro-optical color cameras, or a pod with forward and side- looking IR cameras, both with high resolution. The Raven has a 4.5-ft wingspan almost twice that of Wasp III and it weighs in at more than four times the Wasp's weight.

The hardware considered in this research for state-of-the-art trending and risk assessment includes man-rated aircraft turbine engines, solid rocket motors, and non-man-rated missile and drone turbine engines. © 1985.",,"AIRCRAFT ENGINES, JET AND TURBINE; GAS TURBINES; PROPULSION - Efficiency; ROCKET ENGINES; TECHNOLOGY - Planning; EVOLUTION OF KEY COMPONENTS; NEW WARFIGHTING CAPABILITIES; TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES; WARHEAD DESIGNS; WEAPON PROGRAMS; ORDNANCE",,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, Nelson, (1972) Measuring Technological Change: Aircraft Turbine Engines, , The Rand Corporation, R-1017-ARPA/PR; Archibald, Harman, Hesse, Hiller, Smith, (1981) Factors Affecting the Use of Competition in Weapon System Acquisition, , The Rand Corporation, R-2706-DR&E; Barnett, Lewis, (1978) Outliers in Statistical Data, , Wiley, Chichester, U.K; Belsley, Kuh, Welsch, (1980) Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity, , Wiley, New York; Betts, (1981) Cruise Missiles, Technology, Strategy, Politics, , The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C; Comptroller General, Effectiveness of U.S. Forces Can Be Increased Through Improved Weapon System Design (1981) Report to the Congress of the United States, , PSAD-81-17; Cook, Detection of Influential Observations in Linear Regression (1977) Technometrics, 19 (1), pp. 15-18; Cook, Influential Observations in Linear Regression (1979) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 74 (365), pp. 169-174; Daniel, Wood, (1971) Fitting Equations to Data, , Wiley, New York; Dews, Smith, Barbour, Harris, Hesse, (1979) Acquisition Policy Effectiveness: Department of Defense Experience in the 1970s, , The Rand Corporation, R-2516-DR&E; Draper, Smith, (1966) Applied Regression Analysis, , Wiley, New York; Gunston, (1979) The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the World's Rockets and Missiles, , Crescent Books, a division of Crown Publishers, New York; Harter, Tables of Range and Studentized Range (1960) The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 31, pp. 1122-1147; Hosny, (1974) Propulsion Systems, Revised Edition, Expanded, , University of South Carolina Press, Columbia, SC; Pretty, (1980) Jane's Weapon Systems, 1980–1981, , Jane's Publishing, New York; Maddala, (1977) Econometrics, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Marks, Massey, Bradley, (1978) An Appraisal of Models Used in Life Cycle Cost Estimation for USAF Aircraft Systems, , The Rand Corporation, R-2287-AF; Nelson, (1977) Life-Cycle Analysis of Aircraft Turbine Engines, , The Rand Corporation, R-2103-AF; Nelson, Dey, Fiorello, Gebman, Smith, Sweetland, (1974) A Weapon-System Life-Cycle Overview: The A-7D Experience, , The Rand Corporation, R-1452-PR; Nerlove, Press, (1973) Univariate and Multivariate Log-Linear and Logistic Models, , R-1306-EDA/NIH, The Rand Corporation; Newman, The Distribution of Range in Samples From a Normal Population Expressed in Terms of an Independent Estimate of Standard Deviation (1939) Biometrika, 31, pp. 20-30; Perry, Smith, Harman, Henrichsen, (1971) System Acquisition Strategies, , The Rand Corporation, R-733-PR/ARPA; Pregibon, Logistic Regression Diagnostics (1981) The Annals of Statistics, 9 (4), pp. 705-724; Press, (1965) Statistical Estimation by the Empirical Bayes Method: Some Extensions and Logistical Applications, , RM-4442-PR, The Rand Corporation; Rice, (1979) Defense Resource Management Study, , a report requested by the President and submitted to the Secretary of Defense, U.S. Government Printing Office; Smith, Friedman, (1980) An Analysis of Weapon System Acquisition Intervals, Past and Present, , The Rand Corporation, R-2605-DR&E/AF; Taylor, (1980) Missiles of the World, , Scribner's, New York; Trainor, (1977) Study of Factors Leading to Changes in Cost Estimates on Selected Major Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Development Systems, , (originally submitted as a doctoral dissertation); U.S. Air Force, Program Management Directive Status Report (1980) DCS/Research, Development, & Acquisition, , Management Policy Division, Directorate for Program Integration, prepared by; U.S. Air Force, (1980) Technical Objective Document Fiscal Year 1982, , AFWAL-TR-80-2091, Aero Propulsion Laboratory, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio; U.S. Congress, Inaccuracy of Department of Defense Weapons Acquisition Cost Estimates (1979) Ninth Report by the Committee on Government Operations to the Ninety-Sixth Congress, , Reprint Edition, House Report No. 96-656, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C; Weinschrott, (1976) Polytomous Logit Estimation by Weighted Least Squares, , P-5694, The Rand Corporation; White, (1974) U.S. Tactical Air Power: Missions, Forces and Costs, , The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C","Nelson, J.R.; Dr. Nelson is Principal Engineer at ARINC Research Corporation, Annapolis, MD, United States",,,,,,,,00401625,,,,"English","Technol.

However, there has been a lack of research on consumer preference between drone delivery service and traditional delivery service. This is the first study to analyze the consumer preference for drone delivery based on a discrete choice model between the drone delivery service and traditional delivery services by truck or motorcycle. The discrete choice model is estimated using a stated preference survey, and potential consumers’ preference is analyzed for representative commodities with different price. The results show that the price and type of commodities influence consumer preference, which also depends on socio-demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and household income. Specifically, it was consistently observed in all cases that the younger the age, the higher the preference for drone delivery service. This study contributes to predicting the consumer preference for drone delivery service before real service offerings and to supporting the establishment of business strategies for companies who prepare for the new market of drone-based delivery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer preference; Discrete choice model; Drone; Parcel delivery; Stated preference","age; air transportation; commodity price; discrete choice analysis; gender; household income; preference behavior; service sector; unmanned vehicle",,,,,"Korea Transport Institute, KOTI","This work was supported by the Korea Transport Institute , and this paper is based on the result of Drone Traffic Safety Assessment Metrics Development (2018).",,,,"(2018) Amazon, Amazon Prime Air, , www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?ie=UTF8&node=8037720011, (Accessed 6 November 2018); Ben-Akiva, M.E., Lerman, S.R., Lerman, S.R., (1985) Discrete Choice Analysis: Theory and Application to Travel Demand, 9. , MIT press; Bradley, M., Kroes, E., Forecasting issues in stated preference survey research (1992) Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Survey Methods in Transportation; Brooks, M.R., Puckett, S.M., Hensher, D.A., Sammons, A., Understanding mode choice decisions: a study of australian freight shippers (2012) Marit.

The current research attempts to investigate support for law enforcement usage of UAS, and the factors affecting this support. Methods: A three-study mixed methods approach was taken. In the first study, participants responded to questions asking their level of support for police UAS usage in neighborhoods with varying racial compositions, as well as answering free response questions related to the scenario. The second and third study investigated support for police UAS usage, and whether or not this was influenced by participants' political affiliation. Results: Study one indicated that participants displayed significantly more support for law enforcement's use of UAS when flying over a predominately African-American neighborhood than when flying over a primarily Caucasian neighborhood. Study two furthered these results by finding that those identifying as liberal showed less support for law enforcement UAS use, and expressed higher levels of privacy concerns than those identifying as conservative. Study three further investigated political affiliation using the Nolan Chart survey, finding that libertarians, liberals, conservatives, and authoritarians had differing levels of support and privacy concerns. Conclusions: This research adds to a foundation of understanding consumer acceptance and support for law enforcement UAS usage. As this practice becomes more common, it is important to understand support, as individual perceptions will likely influence actions. This work has numerous practical applications for policy and design. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Aviation; Political affiliation; Privacy; Unmanned aerial systems","Antennas; Aviation; Data privacy; Drones; Fighter aircraft; Social aspects; African American; Consumer acceptance; Free response; Political affiliation; Privacy concerns; Public opinions; Public support; Unmanned aerial systems; Law enforcement; law enforcement; neighborhood; perception; police force; political relations; public sector; racial disparity; unmanned vehicle",,,,,,,,,,"Clothier, R.A., Greer, D.A., Greer, D.G., Mehta, A.M., Risk perception and the public acceptance of drones (2015) Risk Anal., 35 (6), pp. 1167-1183; Finn, R.L., Wright, D., Unmanned aircraft systems: surveillance, ethics, and privacy in civil applications (2012) Comput.

This article relates the ongoing exponential growth of the drone industry in Europe with the vast amounts of EU public research funding channelled to drone research. These projects typically configure partnerships that are neither strictly public, nor strictly private, and it is precisely a combination of their hybrid nature with the centrality of technologial expertise that makes them less visible. This partial invisibility is particularly relevant in the context of a dual-use technology that enables new forms of surveillance, poses societal challenges, and can be used as a lethal weapon. Beyond providing short-term responses to specific problems, we argue that these tactics are largely aimed at fostering a common EU security and defence research & development culture in a time of international security uncertainty. © 2018 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Drones; European security; framework programme; hybridity; Research & Development",,,,,,,"Hidden Security: EU Public Research Funds and the Development of European Drones*","* For comments on previous drafts of this article, we would like to thank Åsne Kalland Aarstad, André Barrinha, Sven Biscop, Nicolas Burmester, Chris Jones, Laura Mawdsley, Michael Strange, and Linda Weiss.

As explicitly stated in the eligibility rules for H2020 and its predecessors, projects supported by the research FPs must not be defence-related, but may have a dual-use nature. Figure 1 illustrates that the Commission has funded drone-related research since its fifth Framework Programme (FP 5, 1998–2002). Under this programme, it funded 13 drone-related projects (among them ARC, CAPECON, COMETS, FASTWING, HELINET and USICO).

While the universities still fulfill these missions, a third mission has been added: university research must establish its direct value to society. However, a lingering question is how this third mission should be carried out. While the earliest models focused on the universities operating similarly to an R&D department in a private company – seeking to patent research inventions and then capitalising on intellectual property rights – the focus today is much more nuanced and incorporates both invention- and innovation-oriented activities. This article captures existing knowledge of universities’ third mission activities and identifies five different models of how universities seek to fulfil the third mission. These models are empirically investigated through two multi-level case studies based on insights from universities’ top management, innovation and/or technology transfer offices, and research units within the emerging drone technology area. The findings illustrate how the two universities seek to fulfil the third mission, based on the same starting point but following different models. Moreover, a sixth model is identified, namely the Ecosystem Model, where the universities engage more extensively and with greater responsibility in collaborative efforts with a range of public and private actors on addressing comprehensive industrial and societal challenges through technology development and market insights. In doing so, the university’s role becomes more active in advancing the development of an industry. This emerging way of fulfilling the third mission is discussed with respect to university management and the achievement of societal goals. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Drones; ecosystem; research; scientific discovery; sustainable development goals; technology transfer; third mission; universities",,,,,,,,,,,"Abernathy, W.J., Utterback, J.M., Patterns of industrial innovation (1978) Technology Review, 80 (7), pp. 41-47; Audretsch, D.B., Keilbach, M., The theory of knowledge spillover entrepreneurship (2007) Journal of Management Studies, 44 (7), pp. 1242-1254; Benneworth, P., Pinheiro, R., Sanchez-Barrioluengo, M., One size does not fit all!

On the other hand, in the competitive market of today, retailers are considering the use of drones to minimize the customers’ waiting times and as a way to lower their transportation costs. This study aims to develop a biobjective mathematical model to account for the optimum number and spatial location of facilities among a set of candidate locations such that the total travel distance, costs, and lost demand are minimized simultaneously. It is assumed that the demand occurrence follows a Poisson distribution and is uniformly distributed along the network edges. The proposed biobjective capacitated facility location model is NP-hard, thus nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II and reference-point based nondominated sorting genetic algorithm are applied to solve the problem. The performance of the algorithms, quality of solutions, and the results are investigated and discussed. © 2019 The Authors.

It is believed that business management courses foster entrepreneurship & innovations, and the ability of the entrepreneurs decides the success or failure of an enterprise. This paper attempted to find out why some entrepreneurs succeed and some don't, and what are the predictors of entrepreneurial success. The findings of the study revealed that entrepreneurial traits and business skills were better predictors of successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs than entrepreneurial attitude. Further, to fathom the distinctive personalities of entrepreneurs, cluster analysis was performed. The four segments identified were lifestyle entrepreneurs, profit-seeker entrepreneurs, drone entrepreneurs, and innovative entrepreneurs. For this study, 103 entrepreneurs, who were MBA graduates, were approached. This research study developed a discriminant model which can classify new cases into successful or unsuccessful entrepreneurs. This study would be useful to bank managers, financial service providers, angel investors, & both aspiring and existing entrepreneurs. © 2018, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The fast evolving spaces of drones and their different uses, from military, to logistics, to leisure create many intertwining structures within a larger ecosystem. This research offers new perspectives by considering the role of the media in assisting with alignment to try to tame the wicked problem associated with a drone ecosystem, the use of drones for leisurely activities. Guided by the principles of the Agenda Setting Theory (AST), the paper elucidates the way drone contents are presented across different media channels; how key themes emerge from the narratives within different media channels; and how (non)convergence of media contents relates to alignment of drone governance. © 2018, Emergent Publications.

It has been 100 years since a drone emerged, but most were used for military purposes. As its use became diverse as of 2010, it got attention of the general public. In Korea, it was in 2011 that a drone was known to the public through an aerial video shooting for television program. This study tried to come up with suggestions by comparing domestic with overseas cases, and tried to consider the related technologies and systems with applying the role of drones in logistics service. Research design, data, and methodology - The overseas cases were regarded as drone's logistical purpose. The Prime Air service by US Amazon is still not commercialized and under pre-testing due to Federal Aviation Regulations, although it started in 2013. In Germany, DHL succeeded in delivering service testing which is called Parcelcopter, but it is not commercialized yet. Other than these, there are more attempts to prepare logistics service in China with Taobao, in France with Geopost's test, and in Africa. In Korea, CJ Korea Express tested delivery with a self-developed drone Results - In order to study for utilizing drones for logistics as the prerequisites, some overseas and domestic cases, which are currently considered, were reviewed. Also, the technologies and institutional requirements to commercialize drones for logistical purpose were reviewed. The reasons for using drones in logistics is to ensure the price competitiveness by reducing cost. The empirical test also will be needed because drone pilot areas are designated by ministry of land, infrastructure and transport. Conclusions - In order to utilize drones in logistics and foster the industry, this study would like to suggest the followings. First of all, size of drones for logistics needs to be fixed and their operating system should be standardized. Centralized investment resources are needed through standardization to ensure the market occupancy. Secondly, it is necessary to get the converged businesses that do research, develop and commercialize drones with the investment of private sector. Example can be found in Korea aerospace Industries. We can respond to the rapid growth of the market with intensive investing by integrating the private sector investment. Thirdly, institutional arrangements are needed to be established quickly. In the case of high-technologies like drones, institutional support often does not follow the rapid development of the technology. The problems can be found in securing drones-only airspace, creating drone-specialized pilot's license, matters related to remote controller and complementary regulations for drones in Aviation Act. If these regulations are not prepared or complemented at the right timing, technologies cannot be commercialized even though the development is completed. Fourthly, there is a need to secure the transparency regarding possible privacy and personal information protection problem while operating drones. Finally, in order to foster this new industry, government should focus on supporting R & D more in the long term than short term outcomes.","Drone; Logistics service; UAV",,,,,,,,,,,"(2015) Revising the Airspace Model for the Safe Integration of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/112715/download/Amazon_Revising_the_Airspace:Model_for_the_Safe_Integration_of_sUAS.pdf, Revising the Airspace Model for the Safe Integration of sUAS, Retrieved July 20, 2015; Canis, B., Unmanned Aircraft System: Commercial Outlook for a new Industry (2015) Congressional research service, , https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44192.pdf, Retrieved September 9, 2015; Cho, S.-W., Lee, D.-S., Jung, Y.-D., Lee, U.-H., Shim, D., Development of a Cooperative Heterogeneous Unmanned System for Delivery Services (2014) Journal of Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems, 20 (12), pp. 1181-1188; Choi, Y.-C., Ahn, H.-S., Current and technology development trends and prospects of drones (2015) The proceedings of KIEE, 64 (12), pp. 20-25; (2014) DHL parcelcopter launches initial operations for research purposes, , http://www.dhl.com/en/press/releases/releases_2014/group/dhl_parcelcopter_launches_initial_operations_for_research_purposes.html, DHL Press release, Retrieved september 24, 2014; Frey, T., (2014) 192 Future Use for flying drones, , http://www.futuristspeaker.com/2014/09/192-future-uses-for-flying-drones/, Retrieved September 2, 2014; (2015) Drone project: Delivery terminal, , https://www.geopostgroup.com/en/news/drone-project-delivery-terminal, Retrieved July 23, 2014; Han, S.-C., Jang, J.-C., Lee, S.-I., Drone technology trend & industry forecast (2015) KEIT PD issue report, 15 (7), pp. 51-69; Jang, Y.-S., Lee, J.-A., Seo, M.-D., Keon, Y.-H., Choi, Y.-H., The Simulation Study on Delivery System for Mountain Regions using UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) (2015) Korean institude of Industrial Engineers, Spring Joint Conference, 4, pp. 3739-3745; Jung, H.-M., UAV regulations for the protection of privacy in the United States (2015) Ministry of Government legislation, 2015 (9), pp. 1-24; Jung, H., Lee, H.-G., Utilizing drones logistics services promotion status (2015) KISDI Postal Information, 101, pp. 13-39. , summer; Regulations related to the world of civil unmanned aircraft (2015) Report prepared by Future Strategy Head Office of KARI, Aviation, 1. , http://e-policy.kari.re.kr/sub0101/articles/view/tableid/default_policy/id/4558, Retrieved May 2015; Kelion, L., (2015) Alibaba begins drone delivery trials in china, , http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31129804, BBC News.

During this stage, vehicles might visit other intermediate nodes for reloading new items. In some real-life scenarios, this problem needs to be solved in just a few seconds or even milliseconds, which leads to the concept of “agile optimization.” This might be the case in some rescue operations using drones in humanitarian logistics, where every second can be decisive to save lives. In order to deal with this real-time two-echelon vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery, an original constructive heuristic is proposed. This heuristic is able to provide a feasible and reasonably good solution in just a few milliseconds. The constructive heuristic is extended into a biased-randomized algorithm using a skewed probability distribution to modify its greedy behavior. This way, parallel runs of the algorithm are able to generate even better results without violating the real-time constraint. Results show that the proposed methodology generates competitive results in milliseconds, being able to outperform other heuristics from the literature. © 2020 The Authors.

Previous studies have framed the challenges facing entrepreneurs in mature organizational fields as avoiding the power of overbearing regulators long enough to establish the legitimacy of their ventures. In fields typified by New Normal conditions, however, regulatory frameworks for evaluating new technology-enabled ventures are often still lacking. Regulators may choose to actively reach out to entrepreneurs to arrive at a better understanding of the radical technological changes and high-frequency entrepreneurial behavioural adaptations that occur in these settings. To grasp how novel regulatory institutional structures come about in the New Normal business landscape, we conducted a processual study of the emergence of a new technology that is the Dutch remotely piloted aircraft systems (drone) industry between 2000 and 2018. Our findings show that regulatory proto-institutions result from dialectic institutional work in the form of structured interactions between entrepreneurs and regulators. Specifically, we present a process model that reveals how new regulatory structures evolve in contexts where high levels of technological and behavioural change induce systemic uncertainty, and enlarge the interdependence between entrepreneurs and regulators. We suggest that our process theory of proto-institutional emergence generalizes towards other organizational fields in which technology-enabled entrepreneurship has become the main driver of growth. Theoretically, our findings speak to the literatures on institutional work, proto-institutional emergence, and the New Normal business landscape. © 2019 The Authors.

The current study also attempted to deepen the VBN model using the moderating role of product involvement. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 428 respondents through an online survey in South Korea. Findings: The results of the data analysis indicated that all proposed hypotheses have been statistically supported in the VBN model. Furthermore, product involvement played a moderating role in the relationship between the sense of obligation to take pro-environmental actions and intentions to use and a sense of obligation to take pro-environmental actions and willingness to pay more. Originality/value: Although drone food delivery services have not yet been fully commercialized, many foodservice companies have conducted pilot tests and the services are likely to be commonly used in the near future. Thus, the findings of this study are expected to have important implications for companies preparing to roll out drone food delivery services. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behaviors; Environmentally friendly drone food delivery services; Product involvement; Value-belief-norm theory",,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), p. 411; (2017) ‘Stop fast now’: every year 1548 food deliveries, dead or injured during delivery, , www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2017092611430473709; Baldassare, M., Katz, C., The personal threat of environmental problems as a predictor of environmental practices (1992) Environment and Behavior, 24 (5), pp. 602-616; Bhattacherjee, A., Sanford, C., The intention–behavior gap in technology usage: the moderating role of attitude strength (2009) Behaviour and Information Technology, 28 (4), pp. 389-401; Black, J.S., Stern, P.C., Elworth, J.T., Personal and contextual influences on household energy adaptations (1985) Journal of Applied Psychology, 70 (1), p. 3; Bratt, C., The impact of norms and assumed consequences on recycling behavior (1999) Environment and Behavior, 31 (5), pp. 630-656; (2017) Shop online and get the delivery of your items by a drone delivery service: the future Amazon and Domino’s have envisioned for us, , www.businessinsider.com/delivery-drones-market-service-2017-7; Byrne, B.M., (2001) Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ; Chang, H.S., Huh, C., Lee, M.J., Would an energy conservation nudge in hotels encourage hotel guests to conserve?

One technique, which has grown in popularity, is the use of drones to capture images within an advertisement. While drones are particularly familiar to military use, new regulations have allowed businesses and amateurs to easily obtain and use drones to create images. With that in mind, this study aims to provide evidence that the verticality of images, i.e., those produced by the drone, can affect information processing of advertising, specifically, angles at which the images are being produced having a greater effect on the viewer than images produced at ground level. We propose a theoretical framework which suggests that mental simulation plays a mediating role between the advertisement watched and Attitude towards the Advertisement (Aad). By creating our own stimuli to eliminate outside discrepancies and focus on images, we were able to carry out an online experiment in which 67 university students participated. Results obtained show how drone images affect Aad as well as the mediating role of mental simulation. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","attitude towards the advertisement; drones; Images’ verticality; mediating effect; mental simulation",,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Imagination and Expectation: The Effect of Imagining Behavioral Scripts on Personal Influences (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45 (2), p. 293; (2017) Caribbean Islands’ Cruise, , https://around.es/producto/crucero-universitario-2018/, December 1, 2017,.

The implementation of drones in logistics sector is a move in this direction. Potential obstacles in the smooth adoption of drones in the logistics sector must be thoroughly analysed. The present study identifies and prioritises the barriers of drone logistics implementation based on their criticality by using the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Initially, 34 barriers are identified through expert opinion and extensive literature review. Furthermore, relevant barriers are finalised among all the barriers by using the FDM. Finally, prioritisation of the barriers based on their criticality is done by AHP technique. The study concludes that regulations and threat to privacy & security are the most critical barriers to implement drones in logistics sector. Public perception & psychological, environmental, technical issues, and economic aspects are the other identified critical barriers. The managerial implications of the findings that could help practitioners and policymakers in the effective implementation of drones in the logistics sector are also discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AHP; barrier analysis; Drone logistics; fuzzy Delphi",,,,,,,,,,,"Agatz, N., Bouman, P., Schmidt, M., Optimization Approaches for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone (2018) Transportation Science, 52 (4), pp. 965-981; Akram, R.N., Markantonakis, K., Mayes, K., Habachi, O., Sauveron, D., Steyven, A., Chaumette, S., (2017), Security, Privacy and Safety Evaluation of Dynamic and Static Fleets of Drones.

A methodology for the propeller and motor selection is developed and augmented with flight time estimation capabilities. Being multirotor-specific it makes use of the platform's simplicity to rapidly provide a set of off-the-shelf components ready to be used in the vehicle. Use of operating points makes the comparison process fast, precise, and tailored to specific application. The method is easily implemented in software to provide an automated tool. Furthermore, clearly defined input and output parameters make it also usable as a module in other multicriteria optimisation algorithms. The new methodology is validated through comparison with a consumer-grade drone and the calculated results are compliant with manufacturer's specification in terms of maximum hover time. © 2020 Marcin Biczyski et al.",,"Multiobjective optimization; Air transport; Automated tools; Flight time; Input and outputs; Multi-criteria optimisation; Off-the-shelf components; Operating points; Vehicle applications; Automobile manufacture",,,,,,,,,,"Szafranski, G., Czyba, R., Blachuta, M., Modeling and identification of electric propulsion system for multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle design 2014 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems 2014, pp. 470-476. , Orlando, FL, USA IEEE ICUAS 2014 - Conference Proceedings 2-s2.0-84904537094; Persson, C., (2019) Drive Calculator, , http://www.drivecalc.de/; (2019) ECalc - The Most Reliable Electric Motor Calculator on the Web for RC Pilots, , https://www.ecalc.ch/, Solution For All Markus Müller; Gatti, M., Giulietti, F., Preliminary design analysis methodology for electric multirotor (2013) International Federation of Automatic Control Proceedings Volumes, 46 (30), pp. 58-63. , 2-s2.0-84896370832; Gatti, M., Complete preliminary design methodology for electric multirotor (2017) Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 30 (5), p. 9. , 2-s2.0-85019993400; Kim, M., Joo, H., Jang, B., Conceptual multicopter sizing and performance analysis via component database (2017) 2017 Ninth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN), 7, pp. 105-109. , Milan, Italy IEEE 2-s2.0-85028045395; Basset, P.M., Tremolet, A., Lefebvre, T., Rotary wing UAV pre-sizing: Past and present methodological approaches at Onera (2014) Aerospace Lab, 8, pp. 1-12; Bershadsky, D., Haviland, S., Johnson, E.N., Electric multirotor UAV propulsion system sizing for performance prediction and design optimization (2016) 57th AIAA/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference, 1, pp. 1-22. , Reston, Virginia American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Dai, X., Quan, Q., Ren, J., Cai, K.-Y., An analytical design-optimization method for electric propulsion systems of multicopter UAVs with desired hovering endurance (2019) IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, 24 (1), pp. 228-239. , 2-s2.0-85062081034; Dai, X., Quan, Q., Ren, J., Cai, K.-Y., Efficiency optimization and component selection for propulsion systems of electric multicopters (2019) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 66 (10), pp. 7800-7809. , 2-s2.0-85058896945; Magnussen, O., Ottestad, M., Hovland, G., Multicopter design optimization and validation (2015) Modeling, Identification and Control, 36 (2), pp. 67-79. , 2-s2.0-84937033436; Miller, J.M., Energy storage technologies (2010) Propulsion Systems for Hybrid Vehicles, pp. 439-522. , Institution of Engineering and Technology chapter 10; Chrome Drones, H., (2019) Drone Thrust Testing, , https://www.halfchrome.com/drone-thrust-testing/; Liang, O., (2019) How to Choose Motor for Racing Drone & Quadcopter, , https://oscarliang.com/quadcopter-motor-propeller/; Traub, L.W., Range and endurance estimates for battery-powered aircraft (2011) Journal of Aircraft, 48 (2), pp. 703-707. , 2-s2.0-79953656637; Propellers, A., (2019) Performance Data, , https://www.apcprop.com/technical-information/performance-data/; Brandt, J.B., Deters, R.W., Ananda, G.K., Selig, M.S., (2019) UIUC Propeller Database, , http://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/props/propDB.html; Control Info, R., Brushless Motor Efficiency and Constants, , http://www.radiocontrolinfo.com/brushless-motor-efficiency/; Dji, (2019) DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0., , https://www.dji.com/phantom-4-pro-v2; Hacker, B20 26 L kv2020 + 4:1, , https://www.hacker-motor-shop.com/Brushless-Motors/Hacker-Inrunner/Hacker-B20/B20-L-with-Gears/B20-26-L-kv2020-4-1.htm?shop=hacker_e&SessionId=&a=article&ProdNr=10017700&p=2072&rdeocl=1&rdetpl=categorypage&rdebox=box4/; Di Franco, C., Buttazzo, G., Energy-aware coverage path planning of UAVs (2015) 2015 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Robot Systems and Competitions, pp. 111-117. , Vila Real, Portugal IEEE; Luna, T., (2018) DJI Mavic 2 Pro Vs.

Considering this reality, the study aims to verify which equipment and vehicles are being applied and which one presents the best benefits to each stage of the supply chain demand. To define the vehicles and equipment to be analyzed, were presented a supply chain process model, divided among industry, warehouses and customer. Thus, each ones were characterized and the best equipment could be adopted more precisely. The vehicles and equipment were analyzed, considering as the main aspects the maintenance cost, security, operation, product handling, delivery time and sustainability. The results show that the main vehicles to be applied are automated guided vehicles, autonomous trains and drones, each one being applied in different processes of the supply chain. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Autonomous equipment; Autonomous vehicles; Industry 4.0; Supply chain; Supply chain 4.0; Supply Chain Processes",,,,,,,,,,,"Dallasega, P., Rauch, E.E., Sustainable construction supply chains through synchronized production planning and control in engineer-to-order enterprises (2017) Sustain, 9 (10); Witkowski, K., Internet of Things, Big Data, Industry 4. 0-Innovative Solutions in Logistics and Supply Chains Management (2017) Procedia Eng, 182, pp. 763-769; Moreira, M., Tjahjono, B., Applying performance measures to support decision-making in supply chain operations: A case of beverage industry (2016) Int.

The Economics of Knowledge. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press], one may wonder why knowledge produced in a given sector does not result in several applications thorough the whole economy. Therefore it is important to understand the dynamics of knowledge that helps a given piece of knowledge to overcome sectorial silos and become more transversal. Here, focusing on Drones, patents analysis reveals how different technical systems use or do not use the same knowledge to solve identical issues or needs. This paper offers three major advantages. First, it allows distinguishing between component knowledge linked with technological bricks and architectural knowledge linked with system integration. Second, it opens new possibilities to measure the transversality of knowledge or its duality (beyond the debates in defense economics). And finally, it offers the opportunity to empirically analyse duality using patent databases. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","capabilities; coherence; drones; duality; patent; Technical system","database; defense industry; knowledge; property rights; technological development",,,,,,,,,,"Acosta, M., Coronado, D., Marín, R., Prats, P., Factors Affecting the Diffusion of Patented Military Technology in the Field of Weapons and Ammunition (2013) Scientometrics, 94, pp. 1-22; Barbaroux, P., dos Santos Paulino, V., Le rôle de la Défense dans l’émergence d’une nouvelle industrie: le cas de l’industrie spatiale (2013) Innovations, 42 (3), pp. 39-58. , August 2; Bijker, W.E., How is Technology Made?

The technology advancement is making the UAV much better in its specification with advances in computing innovation, programming improvement, light-weight materials, worldwide route, propelled information joins, refined sensors and so on, are reinforcing the abilities and fueling the interest for UAVs worldwide. UAV also colloquially known as Drone is a robot that has the ability to operate autonomously without direct control from a human operator. For nations, it is a surveillance tool, meant to watch over nations as Drones have been used in the past for warfare as such, and activities alike. Drones have been a handy gadget to get “Ariel photography” for many decades and used for intelligence and anti-terrorist outcomes. Today the drones are much more versatile and are moving the industry ahead in its reach for activities as monitoring, investigation, product deliveries, aerial photography, healthcare, disaster relief management, agriculture and even drone racing. There are other types of drones too such as boats, submarines, and ground-based robots. The primary purpose is to explore the usage of drones in Humanitarian causes such as disaster relief and social causes as health care. © BEIESP.","Ariel view; Community and social services; Drones; Flying bots; Geospatial mapping; Unmanned ariel vehicles",,,,,,,,,,,"Altawy, R., Youssef, A.M., Security, privacy, and safety aspects of civilian drones: A survey (2017) ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems, 1 (2), p. 7; Bäckman, A., Hollenberg, J., Svensson, L., Ringh, M., Nordberg, P., Djärv, T., Claesson, A., Drones for provision of flotation support in simulated drowning (2018) Air Medical Journal, 37 (3), pp. 170-173; Boucher, P., 'You Wouldn't have Your Granny Using Them': Drawing Boundaries Between Acceptable and Unacceptable Applications of Civil Drones (2016) Science and Engineering Ethics, 22 (5), pp. 391-1418; Ferranti, L., Cuomo, F., Colonnese, S., Melodia, T., (2018) Drone Cellular Networks: Enhancing the Quality of Experience of Video Streaming Applications, , Ad Hoc Networks; Goodchild, A., Toy, J., Delivery by drone: An evaluation of unmanned aerial vehicle technology in reducing CO2 emissions in the delivery service industry (2017) Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2017.02.017; Hassanalian, M., Rice, D., Abdelkefi, A., Evolution of space drones for planetary exploration: A review (2018) Progress in Aerospace Sciences; Khan, M.A., Ectors, W., Bellemans, T., Ruichek, Y., Janssens, D., Wets, G., Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Traffic Analysis: A Case Study to Analyze Traffic Streams at Urban Roundabouts (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 130, pp. 636-643; Klosterman, S., Melaas, E., Wang, J., Martinez, A., Frederick, S., O'keefe, J., Friedl, M., Fine-scale perspectives on landscape phenology from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography (2018) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 248, pp. 397-407; Li, Y., Lu, H., Nakayama, Y., Kim, H., Serikawa, S., Automatic road detection system for an air–land amphibious car drone (2018) Future Generation Computer Systems, 85, pp. 51-59; Matolak, D.W., Unmanned aerial vehicles: Communications challenges and future aerial networking (2015) Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC), 2015 International Conference On, pp. 567-572. , February, IEEE; Moskowitz, E.E., Siegel-Richman, Y.M., Hertner, G., Schroeppel, T., Aerial drone misadventure: A novel case of trauma resulting in ocular globe rupture (2018) American Journal of Ophthalmology Case Reports, 10, pp. 35-37; Aswini, N., Krishna Kumar, E., Uma, S.V., UAV and obstacle sensing techniques-a perspective International Journal of Intelligent Unmanned Systems, , https://doi.org/10.1108/IJIUS-11-2017-0013; Nakamura, H., Kajikawa, Y., (2017) Regulation and Innovation: How Should Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Be Regulated?, , Technological Forecasting and Social Change; Tatham, P., Stadler, F., Murray, A., Shaban, R.Z., Flying maggots: A smart logistic solution to anenduring medical challenge Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management, , https://doi.org/10.1108/JHLSCM-02-2017-0003; Rabta, B., Wankmüller, C., Reiner, G., A drone fleet model for last-mile distribution in disaster relief operations (2018) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 28, pp. 107-112; Rao, B., Gopi, A.G., Maione, R., The societal impact of commercial drones (2016) Technology in Society, 45, pp. 83-90; Seguin, C., Blaquière, G., Loundou, A., Michelet, P., Markarian, T., Unmanned aerial vehicles (Drones) to prevent drowning (2018) Resuscitation, 127, pp. 63-67; Vacca, A., Onishi, H., Drones: Military weapons, surveillance or mapping tools for environmental monitoring?

There are now also other uses both governmental and commercial (in the US and abroad). Many military drones are still being made, however, especially for surveillance and targeted killings. Regarding the latter, this essay calls into question their legality and morality. It recognizes that the issues are complex and controversial, but less so as to the killing of non-combatant civilians. The government using drones for targeted killings maintains secrecy and appeals to non-traditional justifications. Most scholars who assess these killer drone practices support citizen immunity, either by favoring a modified just war theory that prioritizes civilians’ right to life or by challenging official deviations from applicable laws. They accordingly declare such killing immoral if not a war crime. The manufacturers of these killer drones are not themselves the killers, but they are abetters, i.e., sine qua non facilitators. So, I argue that any company concerned about its corporate social responsibility should cease manufacturing them. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Drones; Right to life; Targeted killings",,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, A., (2013) The thistle and the drone: How America’s war on terror became a global war on tribal islam, , Brookings Institution Press, Washington, DC; Who will fight the next war?

Although these multi-rotor devices are not able to fly long distances yet, they are very efficient instruments for taking aerial photographs of their proximate environment. As they are able to float and rotate along their vertical axis to a discretionary direction, they can be used for monitoring and taking pictures of a building from several directions. If pictures are taken of a building from all directions with significant overlap (of at least 50%) the 3D reconstruction of the building in a photogrammetric way becomes possible. The reconstructed models do not only contain the spatial forms but also the visualinformation based on the snapshots. As a result of the entire reconstruction a virtual object is gained in the virtual space that can freely be accessed and visible from all directions by enlarging or reducing the size. A virtual collection can be established for monuments, historical buildings or other spectacular objects worth recording. The objects of the collection (buildings) are lifelike and can be perceived and studied by anyone. The 3D models, of course, cannot substitute the photographs of high resolution but they can complement them in the collection. © 2018 Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems.

In this article we introduce multiple imputation (MI) as the best available method for minimizing the impact of missing perpetrator information on quantitative analyses of political violence, a method that can easily be incorporated into most quantitative research designs. MI will produce unbiased attributions when the reasons for missingness are known and can be controlled for using observed variables, rendering responsibility for unclaimed attacks, “missing at random” (MAR) – which we show is a reasonable assumption in the case of political violence based on current theory of militant group claiming. We lay out the logics and steps of MI, identify variables and data sources, and demonstrate that MI produced better results in the case of the Pakistani Taliban’s response to drone strikes. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","civil wars; conflict; events data; multiple imputation; terrorism",,,,,,,,,,,"Abbas, H., Defining the Punjabi Taliban Network (2009) CTC Sentinel, 2 (4). , http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/defining-the-punjabi-taliban-network, Accessed July 19, 2013; Abbas, H., (2014) The Taliban Revival: Violence and Extremism on the Pakistan-Afghanistan Frontier, , New Haven, CT, Yale University Press; Achen, C.H., (1986) The Statistical Analysis of Quasi-experiments, , Los Angeles, University of California Press; Achen, C.H., Let’s Put Garbage-can Regressions and Garbage-can Probits Where They Belong (2005) Conflict Management and Peace Science, 22 (4), pp. 327-339; Allison, P.D., (2001) Missing Data.

Our method is based on biomimetics, which enable highly autonomous localization. Our method does not need any instruction signals, including even global positioning system (GPS) signals. An experimenter simply blows a whistle, and the MAV will then start to hover, to seek an odor source, and to keep hovering near the source. The GPS-signal-free control based on visual sense enables indoor/underground use. Moreover, the MAV is light-weight (85 grams) and does not cause harm to others even if it accidentally falls. Experiments conducted in the real world were successful in enabling odor source localization using the MAV with a bio-inspired searching method. The distance error of the localization was 63 cm, more accurate than the target distance of 120 cm for individual identification. Our odor source localization is the first step to a proof of concept for a danger warning system. These localization experiments were the first step to a proof of concept for a danger warning system to enable a safer and more secure society. © 2017 ASTES Publishers.

However, thus far, no explanation has been offered for why start-ups differ in their responses to regulatory constraints. Based on 49 interviews with start-ups and other industry actors this paper examines start-ups’ responses to regulatory constraints in the market for drone applications. We find that variation in start-ups’ responses is instigated by start-ups’ temporal orientation. Start-ups pursuing applications targeted at present markets or future potential markets treat regulation as exogenous. In contrast, start-ups that pursue market applications bridging current and future potential markets are more likely to treat regulation as endogenous. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","M13 new firms; Sectorial Planning Methods; Start-ups, l22 firm organization and market structure, l52 industrial policy","Drones; Market applications; Potential markets; Strategic response; Commerce",,,,,,"The authors thank The Danish Industry Foundation for funding a large part of the data collection.",,,,"Aldrich, H.E., Fiol, C.M., Fools rush in?

Most of the tour operators are based in Vava’u archipelago which represents an important breeding ground for Oceania humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). This study represents an assessment of the effects of swimmer approaches on humpback whales’ behaviour using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). UAV flights took place during the 2016 and 2017 whale breeding seasons from onboard research and swim-with-whales vessels. Whales’ behavioural states (resting, travelling, surface-active, socialising, nurturing) were assessed from aerial videos and the proportions of time spent in each state in the presence and absence of swimmers were compared. Whale agonistic behaviours directed towards swimmers and the injury of a swimmer caused by a whale were documented. Results indicate that in-water tourism activities significantly altered the time spent in each behavioural state by humpback whale in Vava’u. Mother-calf pairs decreased the proportion of time spent nurturing, while the time spent travelling increased two-fold when approached by swimmers. These findings indicate a potential energy expenditure increase for humpback whale mothers and their calves in response to swim-with tourism activities in Vava’u. Moreover, whales’ behavioural responses can pose danger of injury to swimmers. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","behaviour; drones; impact; injury; swim-with-whales","aerial survey; behavioral response; ecotourism; swimming behavior; tourist attraction; unmanned vehicle; whale; Tonga; Vavau; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,"Center for Arabic Study Abroad, University of Texas, Austin, CASA

This paper begins by framing drones in healthcare as a social experiment where ethical guidelines are needed to protect those impacted while fully realizing the benefits the technology offers. Then we propose an ethical framework to facilitate the design, development, implementation, and assessment of drones used in public healthcare. Given the healthcare context, we structure the framework according to the four bioethics principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice, plus a fifth principle from artificial intelligence ethics: explicability. These principles are abstract which makes operationalization a challenge; therefore, we suggest an approach of translation according to a values hierarchy whereby the top-level ethical principles are translated into relevant human values within the domain. The resulting framework is an applied ethics tool that facilitates awareness of relevant ethical issues during the design, development, implementation, and assessment of drones in public healthcare. © 2020, The Author(s).","Applied ethics; Drones; Public healthcare; Robot ethics; Value-sensitive design (VSD); Values hierarchy","article; artificial intelligence; awareness; beneficence; bioethics; drone; human; justice; male; practice guideline; robotics",,,,,,,,,,"Bajde, D., Bruun, M.H., Sommer, J.K., Waltorp, K., General public’s privacy concerns regarding drone use in residential and public areas (2017) In Technical Report: Syddansk Universitet Og Aalborg Universitet.; Bajde, D., Woerman, N., Bruun, M.H., Gahrn-Andersen, R., Sommer, J.K., Nøjgaard, M., Bucher, J.H., (2017) Public Reactions to Drone Use in Residential and Public Areas; (2017) DJI Drones to Gain Privacy Mode after US Army Ban.

By using a humanitarian cargo drone study as a starting point, this paper tackles the challenges that VSD’s lack of commitment to a specific ethical theory generates in practical applications. Besides, it highlights how mainstream ethical approaches usually related to VSD are incapable of solving main ethical dilemmas raised by technological design for well-being in democratic settings. Accordingly, it is argued that VSD’s ethical-democratic import would substantially be enhanced by the espousal of a procedural ethics stance and the deliberative approach to value and welfare entailed by Amartya Sen’s capability approach. Differently from rival ethical–political theories, its normative and meta-ethical foundations better handle human diversity, value-goal pluralism, conflicting vested interests as well as the epistemic-moral disagreements typical of contemporary complex democracies. Particularly, Sen’s capability approach procedural-deliberative tenets result in an “objective-impartial” choice procedure selecting a “hierarchy” of plural incommensurable values and rational goals thus, suitable to validate an applied science such as welfare-oriented technological design in concrete social environments. Conclusions suggest that refining VSD with a capability-based procedural approach to ethics fosters the concern for democracy and social justice while preserving vital scientific-technical standards. Major advantages are at an applied level to delivering ethically and socially justified, but yet highly functional technologies and high-tech products/artefacts. © 2020, The Author(s).","Amartya sen’s capability approach; Democracy; Participatory-deliberative methods; Procedural ethics; Technological design for well-being; Value sensitive design (VSD)","article; artifact; democracy; drone; ethical theory; human; male; social justice; standing; welfare; wellbeing",,,,,,,,,,"Arrow, J.K., (1963) Social choice and individual values, , Wiley, New York; Barbour, R., (2007) Qualitative research kit: Doing focus groups, , SAGE, London; Burbidge, D., Space for virtue in the economics of Kenneth J.

This paper presents the research results of developing and testing a deep learning model for estimating construction site elevations using a drone-based orthoimage. The proposed method includes an orthoimage-based convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder, an elevation map CNN decoder, and an overlapping orthoimage disassembling and elevation map assembling algorithm. In the convolutional encoder-decoder network model, the max pooling and up-sampling layers link the orthoimage pixel and elevation map pixel in the same coordinate. The experiment data sets are eight orthoimage and elevation map pairs (1,536×1,536 pixels), which are cropped into 64,800 patch pairs (128×128 pixels). Experimental results indicated that the 128×128-pixel patch had the best model prediction performance. After 100 training epochs, 21.22% of the selected 2,304 points from the testing data set were exactly matched with their ground truth elevation values; and 52.43% points were accurately matched in ±5 cm and 66.15% points in ±10 cm, less than 10% points exceeded ±25 cm. This research project advanced drone applications in construction, evaluated CNNs' effectiveness in site surveying, and strengthened CNNs to work with large-scale construction site images. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","3D reconstruction; Deep learning; Drone; Elevation map; Orthoimage","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decoding; Drones; Pixels; Signal encoding; Statistical tests; Construction sites; Convolutional encoders; Depth information; Experiment data; Learning models; Network modeling; Research results; Training epochs; Deep learning",,,,,,"This work was supported by the McShane Endowment fund at Marquette University.",,,,"Badrinarayanan, V., Kendall, A., Cipolla, R., SegNet: A deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for image segmentation (2017) IEEE Trans.

The delivery process is currently performed by self-employed contractors (i.e. cyclists); however, in the future, it might be performed using drones, as some pilot tests are currently experimenting with this possibility. This paper outlines a scenario in which a fleet of drones, performing the deliveries, requires a network of strategically located charging stations to support the business. This paper shows how the strategic location of the charging stations affects the overall performance of the system, where the maximum time the customers are willing to wait is limited. To this end, an optimisation model addressing the trade-off between the number of stations and the coverage of the demand is presented. Although not imminent, due to technology and regulatory constraints, this scenario and the formulated model can open new perspectives in the delivery process of meals and other goods. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","autonomous vehicles; drones; meal delivery service; Supply chain network design; urban logistics",,,,,,,,,,,"Agustina, D., Lee, C.K.M., Piplani, R., Vehicle Scheduling and Routing at a Cross Docking Center for Food Supply Chains (2014) International Journal of Production Economics, 152, pp. 29-41. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2014.01.002, Elsevier, and; Arabani, A.B., Farahani, R.Z., Facility Location Dynamics: An Overview of Classifications and Applications (2012) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 62 (1), pp. 408-420. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2011.09.018, Elsevier Ltd, and; Banker, S., (2017), https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2017/08/23/amazons-jeff-bezos-drone-prediction-was-far-too-optimistic/#4f526d511bd3, Iceland Gets A Drone Delivery Service, A Light Version Of Jeff Bezos’ Bold Vision.

Familiarity hypothesis, implying lower risk expectation and higher approval in the group of users, is tested in an online panel survey, concluding that user experience influences risk perception by broadening the scope of perceived possible events and contributes to the ability to evaluate risks. Further, five scenarios of precepted possible events are identified as espionage/spying, business rivalries, ideological attack, blackmailing, unintentional accident. The approval of individual modes of use is then found to be divided into two groups pattern - unlimited use and the use for public good.

However, the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is having an impact on the principles of learning from primary to tertiary levels. The purpose of this paper is to consider how the 4IR has and will continue to impact education at the various levels of learning. Design/methodology/approach: The paper aims to bridge the perceived information gap and provide insights into the kinds of educational preparation and the skills and qualifications that 4IR jobs require. In response, the following are considered: the need to tweak the curriculum, adopt the right technology for in class and online delivery and the projection of other learning techniques and skills that are often not considered pertinent. Data gathering for the report was by discussion with experts and consultation of relevant articles and write-ups from related websites. Findings: The advent of smart communication systems involving artificial intelligence, internet, robotics, virtual reality and digital textbooks has opened a new vista in relation to how and what is learnt in schools. Just as technologies brought about smart communication systems, the 4IR model of higher education is rapidly evolving and as such, curriculum development and review must be dynamic, and it must keep pace with the technological advances and skills required in the twenty first century. Research limitations/implications: More purposeful research needs to be conducted in universities and industries with the intention of accelerating internal and external innovations so that markets can be expanded. Furthermore, efforts to reduce the cost and time of generating innovations will need to be intensified. Practical implications: The value and emphasis that are placed on the acquisition of degrees and paper qualifications are changing rapidly. Although it is traditional for students to compete for admission to the face-to-face classroom model, it is no longer unusual for a student to take courses online from any part of the world and still be accepted into positions usually reserved for traditional classroom education. Social implications: As at today, examples of 4IR services include Uber, Airbnb, Cloud services, Artificial intelligence, Cyber-security, three-dimensional printers, driverless cars and robotics. Machine learning and drone technology are also of growing significance. As yet, subjects dealing with such inventions and innovations are not part of the curriculum of many institutions and this is a cause for concern. Originality/value: The 4IR era will bring great changes to how students are taught and what students must learn as the tools for transformational learning are already overwhelming. Jobs will be scarce for those without the requisite skills, whereas those with the right skills will have to keep up with the pace of technological development, otherwise they too will be left behind. Schools will increasingly become centres for the generation of innovation and its incubation and in all this, quality learning, teaching and knowledge impartation can easily be carried out online. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","4IR; Ajagunna; Education; Ilori; Maritime",,,,,,,,,,,"Bhagi, U., (2017) 12 Reasons why project-based learning is better than traditional classroom learning, , https://elearningindustry.com/project-based-learning-better-traditional-classroom, (accessed: 22 July 2019; Bjorklund-Young, A., (2016) What do we know about developing students’ non-cognitive skills?, , https://edpolicy.education.jhu.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2016/06/NoncognitiveskillsmastheadFINAL.pdf, (accessed, Johns Hopkins School of Education; Institute of Education Policy: 29 July 2019; Blackburn-Dwyer, B., (2016) 8 high-tech gadgets that are making classrooms smarter, , www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/8-high-tech-gadgets-that-are-making-classrooms-sma/; Doepker, M., 5 ways students can graduate fully qualified for the fourth industrial revolution (2019) World Economic Forum Annual Meeting. 22-25 January 2019, , www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/how-students-can-graduate-qualified-for-fourth-industrial-revolution/, visited 22 July, 2019., Davos-Klosters, Switzerland; Gleason, N.W., (2018) Higher education in the era of the fourth industrial revolution.

While drones have experienced spectacular growth in terms of sales and revenue, there remains very little known about how the nuances of recreational drone users negotiate codes of conduct to guide their leisure activities and behavior. Drawing from the overarching notion of leisure etiquette, this research explores the context of two groups of leisure drone users operating in Brisbane, Australia and Singapore. Through participant observation and social media content analysis, the research found that participants negotiated etiquette through three elements–Keeping time, sequence of flights and self-regulation of usage behavior. This research elucidates how leisure etiquette is better understood from the increased presence of recreational drones and offers practical steps for governance and regulations related to technologically-mediated leisure spaces. © 2020, © 2020 Canadian Association for Leisure Studies / Association canadienne d’études en loisir.","codes of conduct; emerging technologies; Remote piloted vehicles; technology-mediated leisure; unmanned aerial vehicles",,,,,,,,,,,"AlYahmady, H.H., Alabri, S.S., Using nvivo for data analysis in qualitative research (2013) International Interdisciplinary Journal Of Education, 2 (2), pp. 181-186; Bell, P., (2016) Here’s where you can fly drones if you’re a tourist, , http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/where-you-can-fly-drones-if-youre-a-tourist_uk_5725f9afe4b0a1e971cb8813, Retrieved, December4, 2017, from; Birtchnell, T., Chapter 16: Drones in human geography (2017) Handbook on Geographies of Technology, pp. 231-241. , Warf B., (ed), Elgar,.

To reduce manpower and pollution this kind of UAV is used in agriculture purposes. Drones are capable of working under strong winds and different climate conditions for agricultural applications in real-time. This article proposes an agricultural drone for sowing seeds that has the capability of working under strong winds. To increase its stability and biodiversity, we have used Naza v2 controllers. It is also useful to avoid deforestation in Indian country. Develop the real-time amphibious unmanned aerial vehicle system for the huge agriculture area have the major challenge to enhance the continuous flying time with load. To achieve this challenge, proper weight calculations should be done before it flies with the load. CATIA v5 software is used to design the drone from the top, bottom, right and left views with exact calculations. This project was designed in three phases i.e design of drones, the building of payload and evaluation of drone in PROTEUS and CATIA software. The design calculations along with thrust values are also calculated for payload weights. It is capable of complete autonomous operation and carries special payload bay with seed balls that contain different seed according to the biodiversity spread of the regions and it has the capability of dropping the seed balls at an interval of 15 m in all directions. One drone has the capacity of dropping 28800 seed balls in one eight-hour operation. In one-month, complete operation these drones can drop 8.64 Lakhs seed balls which hopefully brings back the serenity of this nation. © 2020, Research Trend.

The factors which define the scope of world agricultural production are identified. It has been stated that at present a wide use of digital technologies is a key trend of the world economy of the last decade. World leaders in digital technology application are IT-companies, media, finance and insurance. The level of digitalization is much lower in true production and logistics. Agriculture is the last in the list. Basic components of digital infrastructure in the country were analyzed: telecommunication, geo-informational and mobile telecommunication. A successful experience in the introduction of updated financial technologies, oriented mostly on small agribusiness, farmers, was studied. It has been established that a branch standard in agriculture has to be the use of the system of geo-positioning, complex management of a machinery fleet, precise agriculture. A comparative analysis of the technology efficiency was made: aeroponics, hydroponics, traditional agriculture. The world market forecast of agricultural drone sales was presented. Major principles of the policy of “Ukraine’s digitalization” were identified. Five key components which constitute “digital” economy and, in turn, are in the center of “Digital agenda of Ukraine-2020” are suggested. The example of the support of the development of digital technologies and the initiatives of the EU concerning the development of digital economy was presented.

The purpose of this paper is to explore current and potential applications of drones in manufacturing, examine the opportunities and challenges involved and propose a research agenda. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reports the result of an extensive qualitative investigation into an emerging phenomenon. The authors build on the literature on advanced manufacturing technologies. Data collected through in-depth interviews with 66 drone experts from 56 drone vendors and related services are analyzed using an inductive research design. Findings: Drones represent a promising AMT that is expected to be used in several applications in manufacturing in the next few years. This paper proposes a typology of drone applications in manufacturing, explains opportunities and challenges involved and develops a research agenda. The typology categorizes four types of applications based on the drones’ capabilities to “see,” “sense,” “move” and “transform.” Research limitations/implications: The proposed research agenda offers a guide for future research on drones in manufacturing. There are many research opportunities in the domains of industrial engineering, technology development and behavioral operations. Practical implications: Guidance on current and promising potentials of drones in manufacturing is provided to practitioners. Particularly interesting applications are those that help manufacturers “see” and “sense” data in their factories. Applications that “move” or “transform” objects are scarcer, and they make sense only in special cases in very large manufacturing facilities. Originality/value: The application of drones in manufacturing is in its infancy, but is foreseen to grow rapidly over the next decade. This paper presents the first academically rigorous analysis of potential applications of drones in manufacturing. An original and theory-informed typology for drone applications is a timely contribution to the nascent literature.

To date, almost 100 public and commercial flights have been flown at DFW in support of law enforcement activities, fire safety, airport construction and private industry videography. The path to FAA issuance of sUAS certificates of authorization (COA) was paved by a concerted effort among a broad cross-section of aviation professionals with an interest in integrating UAS operations into the DFW environment. The DFW UAS Work Group worked diligently on many aspects of sUAS operations, ranging from COA application to UAS education to flight procedures development. Collaboration between airport representatives and various entities within the FAA resulted in an executed letter of agreement that supports public and commercial sUAS flights over airport property. This paper describes the methodology applied by the work group that led to successful sUAS flight operations. The paper also identifies barriers encountered and the processes applied to mitigate those issues. The author and the DFW UAS Work Group would like to share information that would hopefully assist other airports in developing a sUAS flight programme. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS.","Airspace jurisdiction; Authorised sUAS flights; Collaborative effort; Drone detection; LAANC; Letter of agreement",,,,,,"Federal Aviation Administration, FAA","is Vice President — Operations at Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport.

We argue that conditions of threat can increase public support for the use of drone strikes. We further contend that the effect of threat perceptions on support for drone strikes is mediated by negative, emotional reactions, particularly anger. We test our arguments in France, the United States, and Turkey using data generated from nationally representative online surveys, in which individuals were randomly assigned to a control group, a condition in which they read about terrorist threat (with or without a reminder of democratic values), or a condition in which they read about economic threats. Our findings have implications for long-standing notions about the roles of rational calculations and psychological processes in influencing support for aggressive foreign policy. © The Author(s) 2018.","drones; emotions; foreign policy; public opinion",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 0851136, 0850824","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Support for this project was granted from the National Science Foundation (Award ID #s 0850824 and 0851136).",,,,"Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The Moderator-mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research: Conceptual, Strategic and Statistical Considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Baum, M., Groeling, T.J., (2009) War Stories: The Causes and Consequences of Public Views of War, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Berinsky, A.J., (2009) In Time of War: Understanding American Public Opinion from World War II to Iraq, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Boyle, M.J., The Costs and Consequences of Drone Warfare (2013) International Affairs, 89 (1), pp. 1-29; Borrud, G., Sarkozy Intensifies Anti-immigration Rhetoric (2012) DW, , http://www.dw.com/en/sarkozy-intensifies-anti-immigration-rhetoric/a-15703843, March 12; Brooks, C., Manza, J., (2013) Whose Rights?

At present, methods used to measure ambient air concentrations are continuous methods that are fully automatic (monitoring stations) and discontinuous instrumental methods, using numerical display devices equipped with sampling probes. There are situations in which the smokestack does not have inspection holes for taking samples or there is no platform located at the appropriate height (recommended by normative acts) or certain situations where the smokestack height is 30-50 m making it impossible to sample burned gases. Lately, drones have become more and more intelligent, and given the current complexity and performance of hardware and software, we could say that this development will take place swiftly. The current paper explores the possibility of using drones equipped with gas sensors to measure industrial gas emissions from large combustion plants. In this case, account shall be taken of air currents generated by drones and temperature of discharged exhaust gases. This method has a character of novelty because drones are not currently used in industry. The results of the research will conclude if drones equipped with sensors will or will not be widely used in this field, given their advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, this paper will be a starting point for future research regarding gas emissions measurements both by using drones and the standardized measurement method (sampling inside smokestacks). Also, the use of aerospace vehicles (drones) will be a real help for improving services, quick reaction in case of damages, for the safety and security of workers. © 2018, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

This paper aims to introduce a collaborative parcel delivery problem by truck and drone (hereinafter called ""TDRP"") and propose a novel heuristic method to solve the problem. Research design, data, and methodology: -To show the effectiveness of collaborative delivery by truck and drone, we generate a toy problem composed of 9 customers and the speed of drone is assumed to be two times faster than truck. We compared the delivery completion times by 'truck only' case and 'truck and drone' case by solving the optimization problem respectively. Results: -We provide literature reviews for truck and drone routing problem for collaborative delivery and propose a novel and original heuristic method to solve the problem with numerical example. By numerical example, collaborative delivery is expected to reduce delivery completion time by 12~33% than 'truck only' case. Conclusions: -In this paper, we introduce the TDRP in order for collaborative delivery to be effective and propose a novel and original heuristic method to solve the problem. The results of research will be help to develop effective heuristic solution and optimize the parcel delivery by using drone. © 2018 Chinese Institute of Automation Engineers.","Collaborative delivery; Drone routing; Heuristic method; Synchronization constraints",,,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE

Imposed regulations-federal, state and local statutes, regulatory agency promulgations and executive orders-rest on top of and interact with organic regulations-social customs, markets, private agreements and common law. We show how organic regulation, with its many distributed control points (courts, markets and individuals) and near-continuous decision making (by individuals and judges), better reflects the complex systems nature of and more closely evolves with economies and societies. Imposed regulations offer efficiencies and uniformity, but their fewer, more-indirect design and control points (legislatures, agencies and officials) are less accountable and invite public-choice concerns unrelated or counter to public welfare. As a result, imposed regulations are more prone to error, corruption and unintended consequences and are less predictable long-term. Greater reliance on organic regulation correlates with greater entrepreneurship, innovation and long-term economic growth. We consider case studies of self-driving vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles ('drones') and conclude with recommendations for regulators, lawmakers and policy makers. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Common law; Complex systems; Conflict resolution; Drones; Economic growth; Entrepreneurship; Evolution; Innovation; Law; Public choice; Regime uncertainty; Regulation; Self-driving vehicles; Technology; Unintended consequences; Unmanned aerial vehicles",,,,,,,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., (2009) The Crisis of 2008: Structural Lessons for and from Economics, , http://economics.mit.edu/files/3703, [online] accessed 28 October 2016; Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, J., An African success story: Botswana (2003) Search of Prosperity: Analytic Narratives on Economic Growth, pp. 80-119. , Rodrik, D.

However, with surging demand for RPA combat operations, the United States Air Force (USAF) has struggled to train and retain sufficient manpower to operate these aircraft. As part of a recent effort by the Secretary of Defense to stabilize manpower trends in the USAF RPA enterprise, we developed a dynamic manpower projection model to quantify the potential impact of more than 50 policy initiatives. Ultimately, the model showed that a combination of five major policy initiatives would most efficiently and expeditiously improve manpower trends. The Air Force has already begun to implement these initiatives as part of a plan that will affect over 1,100 active-duty airmen operating a multibillion-dollar enterprise. In this paper, we discuss the background and complexity of the RPA manpower problem, the metrics that we used to evaluate the manpower system, and the modeling techniques we employed to inform a comprehensive solution to mitigate this manpower shortfall. © 2017 INFORMS.","Dynamic Markov manpower model; Manpower planning; Markov chains; Pilot production; Remotely piloted aircraft; United States Air Force",,,,,,,,,,,"Bastian, M., Heymann, S., Jacomy, M., (2009) Gephi: An Open Source Software for Exploring and Manipulating Networks, , https://gephi.org/publications/gephi-bastian-feb09.pdf, Accessed September 16, 2016; De Feyter, T., Guerry, M.A., Markov models in manpower planning: A review (2011) Mathematics Research Developments.

The term drones covers a very broad category of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS) that can be used for anything from military or commercial purposes, to personal entertainment. The government has granted permission to the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) to use drones for aerial surveillance of its pipelines. This follows the use of drones for similar purposes by the Indian Railways and the National Highways Authority of India. as line patrolling is extremely difficult for pipeline sections passing through forests, rivers, environmentally sensitive areas and other inaccessible areas, GAIL (India) Limited has awarded an order for aerial surveillance of 200 kilometres for the Hazira Vijaipur Jagdishpur/Dahej Vijaipur pipelines with drones as a pilot project by Minister of State (independent charge) of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan. Currently, it is being achieved through regular, periodic, foot-patrolling and air surveillance by hiring helicopter services on a monthly basis. With limited transport infrastructure Indian logistics must look in to use of drones Safely. Before any such change can happen in logistics industry it is high time to measure and monitor the awareness towards drone logistics among Indians. This forms the need for the present study. The study objective covers the overall awareness towards drone logistics among public. Specifically, it focuses on the awareness on benefits and cost aspects of the service in India. The study was conducted among the online customers of Snapdeal and Amazon for a specific period of two months. The customers are chosen from a reputed educational institution randomly selected using simple random sampling. The results of the study showed that 'Awareness that drone was trialed by Amazon.inc' and 'not used by Snap deal/Flipkart/Amazon.in', 'awareness of non-availability of drone delivery in India, drones are impersonal way of delivering goods' and 'awareness that drones are comparatively costlier'are significant while estimating overall awareness towards drone delivery, as the significance of 't' is less than 0.05. To conclude, the public awareness towards the usage of drone services was good and identifies it as one of the costlier services in India. © Serials Publications Pvt.

In 2014, the Vice-President of the European Commission and Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, Neelie Kroes, described its emergence as ""people with greater access to information, people empowered to shape the world around them. More able to both learn: and participate"".1 Yet, while the benefits of this vision are clear, harnessing the opportunities on offer requires confronting significant challenges. In seeking to explore what this empowering concept means for law and policy-makers today, this Seminar is intended to encourage reflection upon how increasing digitisation and hyper-connectivity affects our day-to-day interactions with those in power, as well as the security and privacy issues arising from them. For example, in many countries the development of new forms of digital identity management enables citizens to assert their identity electronically in order to access public services (such as online access to their medical data). However, these can only work optimally when supported by citizen-centric policy and legal frameworks that are technology-neutral, trust enhancing and mutually recognised across borders. New data-driven and virtual relationships with governments also necessitate a reconsideration of the rights that digital citizen deserve. On the one hand, the ease with which increasing amounts of accessible personal data can be collected - overtly or covertly - and analysed by states about their citizens' raises concerns about lost privacy controls and substantial power imbalances (such as regarding storage and access rights to such data). On the other hand, massive improvements in accessing information permit opportunities for greater engagement with government by individuals, yet assume the rollout of better and faster internet connectivity for all citizens to participate. In turn, social media has demonstrated how ICT can facilitate collective citizen activism to pressure for societal change, alongside the power of sousveillance to act as a countervailing force to pervasive state monitoring. Also ripe for discussion is the notion of reciprocal responsibilities between citizens and governments. In the physical space, for example, concerns are mounting over the implications of the advent of cheap wearable computers and drones. In the virtual domain, the borderless nature of the online world and its distributed control has connotations for a wider concept of networked citizenship with attendant rights. This led the creator of the Web - Sir Tim Berners-Lee - to call for a Bill of Rights (a 'Magna Carta for the Web') in 2014, the Web's 25th birthday, to protect its users. Citizen rights that already exist relevant to the online environment are scattered across various laws and are not always easy to understand. The roles of transnational institutions in fostering closer international cooperation on ICT policy, as well as strengthening confidence in privacy, consumer and data protection rights online, are also topics for discussion in this respect. Questions for discussion include: What does digital citizenship mean today? What rights, obligations and responsibilities should be associated with digital citizenship? What types of legal solutions are fit for purpose to protect digital citizenship interests? What should be the role of public sectors in e-identity assurance schemes, such as regarding liability? Should e-identity management be regulated? How does digital citizenship relate to novel rights, such as a right to public-sector data and a right to be forgotten online, and how might these rights be enforced effectively? To what extent can law and policy support increase transparency and trust by citizens in the actions of their governments? How can privacy and security be guaranteed to citizens where automated technologies affect their rights and civil liberties? How are biometrics and location-tracking devices used by states in body surveillance changing the digital citizenship landscape? How can individuals be more empowered to control their personal data held by governments and give informed consent to its use? What are the global drivers of digital citizenship policies and international cooperation in rule making and standard setting, especially in relation to emerging sensor-embedded technologies that will change the lives of citizens dramatically in the future? © 2015 the individual speakers.","Biometrics; Citizenship; Digital citizen; E-governance; Globalisation; Identity assurance; Internet of things; Rights; Sousveillance; Surveillance","Biometrics; Consumer protection; Digital devices; Digital storage; Electronic document identification systems; Environmental regulations; Government data processing; International cooperation; Internet of things; Network security; Public policy; Space surveillance; Telemedicine; Virtual reality; Citizenship; Digital citizen; E-governance; Globalisation; Identity assurance; Rights; Sousveillance; Data privacy",,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/J004995/1",,,,,"(2014) Science 2.0 Conference, , Hamburg, 26-27 March; Smith, A., (1998) Laclau and Mouffe: The Radical Democratic Imaginary, p. 177. , London: Routledge; Lister, R., (1997) Citizenship: Feminist Perspectives, p. 41. , New York: New York University Press; Oldfield, A., (1990) Citizenship and Community: Civic Republicanism and the Modern World, p. 145. , London: Routledge; Vincent, J., (2012) 'Digital Identity Issue'.

The author makes the case that this is the right time for practitioners to strategically evaluate the benefits and costs of providing or using drones to achieve their social and environmental objectives. As shown below, drones can be connected to the social and environmental objectives of businesses, including worker health and safety, customer service, market image, and innovation. The civilian or commercial drone market in the United States is just beginning to emerge, which puts U.S. businesses behind businesses in other countries, because U.S. regulations have been more restrictive.

Design/methodology/approach-Opinion piece. Findings-There are several cutting edge but increasingly affordable technologies which could attract students to the library and raise the library’s profile. Research limitations/implications-It would be interesting to design a study of library use and determine if the addition of unusual technologies had any effects. Practical implications-Given the affordability of some devices, there is little risk involved in proceeding with establishment and furnishing of a Center for Digital Learning, Teaching and Scholarship at the library. Originality/value-Aliterature search for drones and libraries retrieved no scholarly articles, but did bring back one or two news pieces about circulating drones at the University of South Florida. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","3D printers; 3D scanners; Drones; Inflatable study pods; Publishing in libraries; Technology in libraries",,,,,,,,,,,"Rosen, J., Are book machines the right fit for indies?

Despite a number of innovative solutions available, many challenges in agricultural supply are still prevalent, with researchers to date largely focusing on these challenges in isolation, as opposed to exploring the relationships held between these challenges. Thus, supported by Circular Economy, Agriculture, Industry 4.0 literature and expert opinions, agricultural supply chain challenges are modelled and analysed using ISM methodology to help uncover 12 agricultural challenges which ultimately impede goods moving within the supply chain.

Could drone application be the next game changer? Building on the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) model, we conducted a study to examine public perceptions of drone application in a South East Asian city state. While there are a number of common findings with past research, we were able to extend the understanding of drone application in urban areas with the following findings. First, using two knowledge tests, we were able to confirm that the majority of the public seems to have a good understanding of what a drone is. Second, acceptance levels towards drones did significantly differ depending on the context of use. Industrial areas had the highest acceptance level, followed by recreational areas and commercial areas while residential areas had the lowest acceptance level. Finally, different factors may be responsible for the varying levels of acceptance across the different contexts. We provided preliminary evidence that two factors – fears and concerns, and perceived potential benefits – affected the public acceptance levels differently depending on the contexts of drone applications. We concluded with implications for future research and policy makers. © 2020","Drone; Fears and concerns; Perceived potential benefits; Public acceptance; Support","Education; Common findings; Context of use; Implications for futures; Industrial area; Potential benefits; Public acceptance; Public perception; Residential areas; Drones; knowledge; perception; public attitude; remotely operated vehicle; technology adoption; urban area; Southeast Asia",,,,,"Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, CAAS

The data analysis results showed that perceived innovativeness positively affects attitude. In addition, the attitude, the subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control have a positive influence on behavioral intentions.

In this paper, we investigate whether contextual framing affects individuals' behavior in spatial decision making. Although previous research suggests that individuals' judgments are sensitive to contextual (and particularly moral) factors of a scenario, no work has addressed whether this effect extends to spatial decisions. To investigate the impact of context on perceptual sensorimotor behavior, we superimposed two moral dilemmas (which we call help and harm) on a spatial decision-making paradigm. The basic task required participants select a target area while avoiding an overlapping nontarget area. Although the visuospatial task was constant, the moral context was changed when participants had to execute either a drone missile strike on enemies in the harm context or deliver ammunition to allies in the help context. Participants more strongly avoided losses in the harm context, reflected by a greater selection bias away from the nontarget (i.e., allies) on drone strike trials. These findings suggest that the contextual framing of a subjective perceived loss on a spatial decision can drive avoidant motor execution behavior. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","contextual framing; loss aversion; moral decision making; spatial decision making","adult; article; avoidance behavior; controlled study; drone; endowment effect; human; human experiment; male; morality; selection bias",,,,,,"The authors thank Prof. Marlene Berhmann and Roberta Klatzky for their consultation and commentary on previous drafts of this manuscript.

The industry is aiming for a ‘business model transformation’ by means of digitalisation, which includes the use of drone technologies for maintenance functions. In this paper, we explore on what basis might such workers embrace or resist this new technology. Drawing on data from a project investigating the use of drones for a ‘safer, faster and leaner’ workplace, we employ an analysis of technology ‘effects’ to discuss the risks and benefits to workers of drone technologies (see Orlikowski, Organ. Sci., 3, 1992, 398; Edwards and Ramirez, New Technol. Work Employ., 31, 2016, 99). The insertion and use of drone technology within the industry raises questions for the industry’s highly skilled workers and their representatives on the ‘effect’ of drone innovations on the industry’s existing structures and patterns of work. © 2020 The Authors.

UAVs’ relevance within modern society stems from it being able to solve socio-economic issues as well as improve productivity. Sub-Saharan Africa has become a region of global interest with regards to technological development, leapfrogging and foreign investment, despite the lag in socio-economic development in comparison with other regions. Backed by socio-technical theory, the aim of this paper is to investigate UAV adoption and its usage in Sub-Saharan Africa by means of a systematic literature review methodology. Selected papers were reviewed, assessed and results were categorized according to the domain within which UAVs have been and are being deployed in Sub-Saharan Africa. We also determined whether the research reported on existing projects or rather made proposals on the use of UAVs.Our results reveal that UAV adoption in the sub-region is still in its early phase, with a number of implemented cases primarily focusing on healthcare and crop farming. The study makes theoretical and practical contributions to the topic of UAVs/drone technology within the sphere of Sub-Saharan Africa from a socio-technical perspective. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Socio-technical theory; Sub-saharan africa; Systematic review; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Antennas; Economics; Investments; Productivity; Foreign investment; Socio-economic development; Socio-technical perspective; Socio-technical theories; Sub-saharan africa; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Technological development; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); literature review; socioeconomic conditions; technological development; technology adoption; unmanned vehicle; Sub-Saharan Africa",,,,,,,,,,"Asongu, S., Boateng, A., Akamavi, R.K., (2016) Mobile Phone Innovation and Inclusive Human Development: Evidence from Sub-saharan Africa, 16, p. 27. , African Governance and Development Institute WP; Ackerman, E., Strickland, E., Medical delivery drones take flight in east africa (2018) IEEE Spectrum, 55 (1), pp. 34-35; McCall, B., Sub-Saharan Africa leads the way in medical drones (2019); Kitchenham, B., (2004) Procedures for Performing Systematic Reviews, 33, pp. 1-26. , Keele University Keele, UK 2004; Altawy, R., Youssef, A.M., Security, privacy, and safety aspects of civilian drones: a survey (2017) ACM Trans.

An EMS is generally able to respond to 90% of higher priority calls in less than 9 minutes, with the best chance of survival being with a response time of 4–5 minutes. The major obstacle here is that a shorter response time would require the needed resources not to pass a certain threshold in a cost/benefit analysis. This paper aims to investigate the use of drones in as an EMS to improve response times. Although the literature already provides many examples of drones used for this purpose, they have all been developed as a prototype. This confirms the technical feasibility of a drone-based solution, but there is no evidence of the economic viability for such a service. The answer to this comes by analyzing the performance of an integrated-with-drones service as a whole. For this reason, we have redesigned the entire EMS model by including drones, and we have addressed the main issues, such as which types of service can be provided from drones, in which case, what the technical requirements for drones would be, and so on. Furthermore, we developed a specific procedure to keep the number of drones at a minimum level under the constraint of the minimum intervention time. The proposed model has been applied to a real EMS case for a city in the south of Italy. The outcome was that 96 drones were able to cover an area of 2,800 km2, providing an intervention time of 4.5 minutes on average at an annual cost of less than €300,000. These results highlight that an integrated-with-drones service drastically improves the response time when compared with the traditional service, doing so at a viable cost. © 2020","Cost/Benefit analysis; Design optimization; Drones; Emergency medical service",,,,,,"Università degli Studi di Salerno, UNISA","The authors would like to thank Antonella D'Aquino for her help in implementing part of the model during her master's thesis in management engineering at the University of Salerno.",,,,"Basten, V., Crevits, I., Latief, Y., Berawi, M.A., Conceptual Development of Cost Benefit Analysis based on Regional, Knowledge, and Economic Aspects of Green Building (2019) International Journal of Technology, 10 (1), pp. 81-93; Dhivya, A.J.A., Premkumar, J., Quadcopter-based Technology for an Emergency Healthcare (2017) 3rd International Conference on Biosignals, Images and Instrumentation (ICBSII); Dulebenets, M.A., Pasha, J., Abioye, 0.

To identify critical issues and research gaps, our systematic literature review findings suggest that historic issues such as privacy, acceptance and security are increasingly replaced by operational considerations including interaction with and impacts on other airspace users. Recent incidents show that unrestricted drone use can inflict problems on other airspace users like airports and emergency services. Our review of current regulatory approaches shows a need for further policy and management response to both manage rapid and efficient drone usage growth, and facilitate innovation (e.g. intraurban package delivery), with one promising strategic response being low altitude airspace management (LAAM) systems for all drone use cases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air traffic control; Future of drones; Innovation; Low altitude airspace management (LAAM); Strategy; Systematic literature review; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","air transportation; airborne sensing; innovation; literature review; strategic approach; transportation development; transportation planning; unmanned vehicle",,,,,,"We acknowledge the contribution and comments received from participants at the 2019 Air Transport Research Society 23rd World Conference.

Automated technologies in freight transportation represent an opportunity to develop more efficient systems characterized by the integration of different and complementary modes. In this study, we focus on the possibility of implementing an integrated truck-robot system for the last-mile delivery. This typology of problem shares similarities with truck-drone problems, although robots are characterized by much slower speeds and can perform several consecutive deliveries. Based on these particular features, a heuristic that efficiently identifies solutions based on initial truck tours and corresponding joint robot operations is presented. This solution approach leverages a special version of the “Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem,” which allows for a very efficient Dynamic Programming solution. The developed solution approach is adopted to analyze the influence on efficiency of different features concerning the robot's design and operation, and the surrounding environment. The results show that robot-assisted last-mile delivery systems are quite efficient if robots are employed in heavily congested areas and appropriately retrofitted to accommodate several compartments in the robot's storage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","City logistics; Integrated truck-robot delivery; Last-mile delivery; Local search with adaptive perturbation; Traveling salesman with robot","cost analysis; electronic commerce; freight transport; logistics; optimization; robotics; supply chain management; trucking; typology",,,,,,,,,,"Agatz, N., Bouman, P., Schmidt, M., Optimization approaches for the traveling salesman problem with drone (2018) Transport.

To be realised, this would require the Very Low Level (VLL) urban airspace to be able to cope with high traffic densities of commercial delivery drones. The potential benefits of such novel drone-based applications are a reduction of traffic congestion in cities, lower greenhouse gas emissions and more efficient transportation operations. To help realise this concept, programs such as U-Space, the unmanned traffic management system for Europe, are developing important services such as deconfliction management and dynamic capacity management. However, for several of these services, design choices will depend on how, and how extensive they will be used. It therefore becomes important to estimate how many delivery drones would operate in a typical city. This paper aims to provide an estimate by establishing a framework to determine the traffic demand for express drone-based package delivery of five European countries. In addition, a detailed case-study is presented for determining traffic density of express package drone delivery for Paris metropolitan area in order to assess the feasibility from a user's perspective. The paper also discusses the potential of fast-food meal delivery drones compared to traditional delivery modes for Paris.

A natural and important question arises: What is the impact of a drone delivery system (DDS) on a retailer’s extant logistics parameters, for example, the number of customer-facing delivery centers (last-mile warehouses) it uses and delivery lead times it offers? On the one hand, the ability to reach customers faster than through traditional means argues for more centralization of delivery services. On the other hand, more decentralization can allow the retailer to offer hitherto unheard-of delivery lead times and thereby spur demand. We show that, as drone technology matures and becomes more cost-effective, delivery networks will become increasingly decentralized while delivering products at faster speeds. While perfect delivery customization—under which each demand location is offered a customized delivery guarantee—is theoretically feasible under a DDS, it may not be practical to implement such a finely differentiated delivery strategy. Instead, we show that retailers can recover a significant portion of the profit under this ideal scenario by offering limited delivery-time customization, that is, partitioning the market into a few delivery “zones” and offering the best feasible delivery guarantee for each zone. In physically congested metropolitan markets, where retailers may be forced to operate with only a few delivery centers, it may be optimal to operate a DDS by offering delivery guarantees that are inferior to the best possible in order to throttle unprofitable demand. In such markets, the effectiveness of limited delivery-time customization increases as the extent of physical congestion increases. © 2020 Production and Operations Management Society","delivery centers and lead times; delivery drones; disruptive technologies; last-mile logistics",,,,,,,,,,,"Agatz, N., Bouman, P., Schmidt, M., Optimization approaches for the traveling salesman problem with drone (2018) Transport.

In recent times, such animosities have widened to the point of dehumanization and wide destruction of properties with threat and fear as strong arsenal. Terrorism has become very prevalent especially its many new forms that use drones and chemical and biological weapons. A mathematical model helps to explain a system (mutable natural occurrences such as dynamics in terrorism) by a painstaking study of different components of terrorists’ splinter cells ranging from foot soldiers, intelligent mission units, kidnappers, and suicide bombers, to make predictions about its behaviour. This work argues the use of mathematical models to study terrorism by providing insights into evolving trends. The specific objective of this study is to investigate how to improve the understanding of the policymakers on terrorism mitigation. The study adopted a mathematical modelling and theoretical design. The mathematical equations formulated were based on the underlying principles of terrorism, which include recruitment, desertion from group, counter-terrorism measures, et cetera. The models were sets of ordinary nonlinear differential equations based on assumptions emanating from the literature reviewed on terrorism. Qualitative analysis and relevant numerical simulations of the model were carried out. The results illustrate new approach on which terrorism can be reduced. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Counter-terrorism measures; Mathematical model; Terrorism dynamics",,,,,,,,,,,"Abiodun, O.I., Jantan, A., Omolara, A.O.E., Singh, M.M., Anbar, M., Terrorism prevention: A mathematical model for assessing individuals with profiling (2018) International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 18 (7), pp. 117-127; May 2019; Caulkins, J.P., Feichtinger, G., Grass, D., Tragler, G., Optimal control of terrorism and global reputation: A case study with novel threshold behavior (2009) Operations Research Letters, 37, pp. 387-391; Collins, O.C., Duffy, K.J., Consumption threshold used to investigate stability and ecological dominance in consumer-resource dynamics (2016) Ecological Modelling, 319, pp. 155-162; Collins, O.C., Govinder, K.S., Stability analysis and optimal vaccination of a waterborne disease model with multiple water sources (2016) Natural Resources Modelling, 29, pp. 426-447; Collins, O.C., Duffy, K.J., Analysis and optimal control intervention strategies of a waterborne disease model: A realistic case study (2018) Journal of Applied Mathematics; Collins, O.C., Duffy, K.J., How species diversity could reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases (2018) Applied Ecology and Environmental Research, 16, pp. 1621-1638; Collins, O.C., Govinder, K.S., Incorporating heterogeneity into the transmission dynamics of a waterborne disease model (2014) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 356, pp. 133-143; Collins, O.C., Simelane, T.S., Duffy, K.J., Analyses of mathematical models for city population dynamics under heterogeneity (2018) African Journal of Science Technology Innovation and Development; (2018), https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/, Accessed Apr 2019; Liao, S., Wang, J., Stability analysis and application of a mathematical model (2011) Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering, 8, pp. 733-752; Lopes, A.M., Machado, J.A.T., Mata, M.E., Analysis of global terrorism dynamics by means of entropy and state space portrait (2016) Nonlinear Dynamics, 85 (3), pp. 1547-1560; Monica, M., Report, V.O.A., (2014) Boko Harams deadliest year, yet over 9,000 killed, about 1.5 million displaced, 800 schools destroyed; Okoye, I.E., Trends in terrorism incidents in Nigeria and the United States: Analysis of data from 1980–2013 (2018) International Journal of Criminal Justice Sciences, 13 (1), pp. 200-211; Omenma, J.T., Hendricks, C.M., Counterterrorism in Africa: An analysis of the civilian joint task force and military partnership in Nigeria (2018) Security Journal, 31 (3), pp. 764-794; Owen-Smith, N., Functional heterogeneity in resources within landscapes and herbivore population dynamics (2004) Landscape Ecology, 19, pp. 761-771; Turchin, P., (2003) Complex Population Dynamics: A Theoretical/Empirical Synthesis, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Udwadia, F., Leitmann, G., Lambertini, L., A dynamical model of terrorism (2006) Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society, 2006, pp. 1-32; Udoh, I.J., Oladejo, M.O., Optimal human resources allocation in counter-terrorism (CT) operation: A mathematical deterministic model (2019) International Journal of dvances in Scientific Research and Engineering, 5 (1), pp. 96-115; van den Driessche, P., Watmough, J., Reproduction numbers and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for compartmental models of disease transmission (2002) Mathematical Bioscience, 180, pp. 29-48","Collins, O.C.; Department of Mathematics, University of NigeriaNigeria; email: obiora.collins@unn.edu.ng",,,"Palgrave Macmillan",,,,,09551662,,,,"English","Secur.

A growing number of studies seek to gauge the public's risk beliefs about drone delivery and inform policy development before its widespread uptake. Complicating these efforts is the fact that beliefs are interconnected and embedded in a cognitive system. This article argues that public outcomes are not based on atomized and isolated beliefs about risks involved in drone delivery, but instead emerge from the patterns in the relationships among these expressed beliefs. However, little is known about the structural characteristics of risk belief systems related to drone delivery, and the implications for risk communication and management. In an effort to fill this void, we conducted a network analysis of risk beliefs about drone delivery based on nationally representative data (N = 1465). The results revealed structural connections among 11 risk beliefs and explored structural variations in the risk belief system between people with different attitudes toward drone delivery. The simulation results showed that risk-mitigating messages instigated greater changes to the public's risk perceptions when they targeted structurally central, as opposed to peripheral, risk beliefs. The reported evidence adds new insights into how risks about drone delivery are configured in the public consciousness, and provides guidance into how practitioners may mobilize structural leverage to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of risk communication strategies. © 2020","Belief system; Drones; Network analysis; Risk communication; Risk perceptions","Cognitive systems; Drones; Public risks; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Policy development; Product delivery; Risk communication; Risk mitigating; Structural characteristics; Structural connections; Structural variations; Risk analysis; electronic commerce; innovation; logistics; network analysis; risk perception; unmanned vehicle",,,,,,,,,,"Federal Aviation Administration, Unmanned Aerial Systems (2018), https://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation/aerospace_forecasts/media/unmanned_aircraft_systems.pdf; Amazon Unveils Futuristic Plan: Delivery by Drone (2013), https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-unveils-futuristic-plandelivery-by-drone/; Joerss, M., Schroder, J., Neuhaus, F., Klink, C., Mann, F., Parel Delivery: the Future of Last Mile (2016), https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/travel%20transport%20and%20logistics/our%20insights/how%20customer%20demands%20are%20reshaping%20last%20mile%20delivery/parcel_delivery_the_future_of_last_mile.ashx; Clothier, R.A., Greer, D.A., Greer, D.G., Mehta, A.M., Risk perception and the public acceptance of drones: risk perception and the public acceptance of drones (2015) Risk Anal., 35, pp. 1167-1183; Soffronoff, J., Piscioneri, P., Weaver, A., Public Perception of Drone Delivery in the United States (RARC-WP-17-001) (2016), https://www.uspsoig.gov/document/public-perception-drone-delivery-united-states; Zhu, X., Segmenting the public's risk beliefs about drone delivery: a belief system approach (2019) Telematics Inf., 40, pp. 27-40; Yoo, W., Yu, E., Jung, J., Drone delivery: factors affecting the public's attitude and intention to adopt (2018) Telematics Inf., 35, pp. 1687-1700; West, J.P., Klofstad, C.A., Uscinski, J.E., Connolly, J.M., Citizen support for domestic drone use and regulation (2019) Am.

The paper presents two studies of zenith image capture in two micro-spaces (both monumental heritage sites) in the north-east of Spain: the first used drone images to conduct a quantitative study on patterns of visitor use at Empúries archaeological site; and the second was a qualitative study on conflicts of use in Cathedral Square, Girona, using time-lapse photography from a fixed camera. Results of the study show that visitor behaviour at the sites does not alter in peak season when spaces become increasingly crowded. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Drone; Overcrowd; Space-time; Time-lapse; Visitor behaviour;

Traditional remote inspections and monitoring are capital intensive and require ample accessibility to infrastructure. UAV inspections look to increase inspection capabilities that were traditionally limited to visual qualitative assessment such as thermal imaging or 3D scanning. A UAV sensor and algorithm package is being developed to include thermal imaging, vibration contact inspections, and lubricant sampling to advance the variety of inspections. Navigation for precise positioning is achieved through visual servoing based on ArUco markers and a control scheme positions the UAV for accurate payload deployment.

In 2018, Oslo airport (ENGM) in Norway had to deal with several unauthorised drones entering controlled airspace within the five-kilometre restriction zone around the airport, resulting in closure of airspace and diversions of aircraft. With about 135,000 aircraft movements and over 28.5 million passengers in 2018, drones represent a challenge for the air traffic control (ATC) at the airport. Avinor Air Navigation Services is the company in charge of handling the air traffic control at Oslo airport. The company has chosen to handle the drone challenge with a proactive approach at the operational level as well as at the strategic level. This paper looks at the increase in drones illegally entering controlled airspace, using the 13th June, 2018, incident at the Oslo airport (ENGM) as a case study. Through this case study, Avinor Air Navigation Services argues that drones have become a disruptive challenge to the aviation industry. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS.","Business development; Change management; Drones; Innovation; Public affairs; Risk management; Safety",,,,,,,,,,,"(2018) 400 000 nordmenn eier en drone!, , https://www.uasnorway.no/400-000-nordmenn-eier-en-drone/, UAS Norway (accessed 5th December, 2018); (2019) Risk-based oversight, , https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Risk-based_Oversight, Skybrary (accessed 5th December, 2018); UAS Norway, , ref. 1 above; (2019) Convergence, , https://www.techopedia.com/definition/769/convergence, Techopedia (accessed 4th January, 2019); (2019) Meld.

Therefore, the drone detection for the restricted areas or special zones is important and necessary. This paper focuses on the drone detection problem based on image processing for the restricted areas or special zones where used cameras for monitoring. The proposed solution detects drones from the captured images based on training the Haar-like features. The dataset of drone images is used in the Haar training process to generate a Haar-cascade model of drones. This model is then used to detect drones from images captured by the camera. The proposed solution is implemented and experimented with single cameras installed for any place including indoor environment and outdoor environment. Experimental results proved that the proposed solution could exactly detect drones for any zone or the restricted areas. The average accuracy of the proposed solution in the experimented environments is 91.9 %, and it provides an easy and economical solution for user.

Data were obtained from an onsite survey of 452 visitors. Questionnaires with embedded photographs measured visitors’ perceived encounters, norms, and crowding (evaluative indicators), while an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to collect actual use levels at the site (descriptive indicator). In total, 63% of respondents felt crowded at this site, suggesting that it is nearing over-capacity. Respondent norms showed that no more than approximately 950 people should be allowed. Use levels exceeding 700 people caused respondents to feel moderately or extremely crowded, yet use levels commonly exceeded this threshold. Standards representing these numeric thresholds should be set at this site, and management action is critical (e.g., quotas, reservations, fees, encourage alternative sites). This research contributes to the literature by demonstrating the importance of all four indicators (use levels, encounters, norms, crowding) when investigating overtourism issues, and the potential of UAVs to support the measurement of descriptive indicators. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","beach tourism; crowding; Indicators; overtourism; UAV; use level",,,,,,,,,,,"Ammour, N., Alhichri, H., Bazi, Y., Benjdira, B., Alajlan, N., Zuair, M., Deep learning approach for car detection in UAV imagery (2017) Remote Sensing, 9 (4), p. 312; Ancin-Murguzur, F., Munoz, L., Monz, C., Hausner, V., Drones as a tool to monitor human impacts and vegetation changes in parks and protected areas (2019) Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation, 6, pp. 105-113; Balouin, Y., Rey-Valette, H., Picand, P., Automatic assessment and analysis of beach attendance using video images at the lido of Sète Beach (2014) Ocean & Coastal Management, 102, pp. 114-122; Bell, C., Needham, M., Szuster, B., Congruence among encounters, norms, crowding, and management in a marine protected area (2011) Environmental Management, 48 (3), pp. 499-513; Butler, R., Tourism carrying capacity research: a perspective article (2020) Tourism Review, 75 (1), pp. 207-211; Cave, J., (2017) Is Kailua Hawaiʻi’s next Waikiki?

This research was conducted following concerns raised by individuals and businesses whose imported drones were seized by customs or had to go through a cumbersome process for approval to use drones for lack of regulations. To derive the policy framework, we matched the provisions of 15 existing drone regulations from Africa to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Manual on Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) using a decomposition modelling technique. The proposed framework is presented as a formal business process model and is evaluated in a multi-case study approach in two different case studies. The results indicate that two key aspects/elements are crucial in the development of a drone framework and thus are included in our framework: (i) stakeholders’ inclusion in the policy development and (ii) regulators liaising with security agencies like the police and immigration officials to implement and enforce developed regulations. Applying the proposed framework in describing existing regulations reveals that 40-85% of provisions in existing regulations conform to the provisions in ICAO’s RPAS manual. © 2020 The Author(s).

Apart from some positive sign of this boost, several other issues have also been developed in the region. One of such issues is the safety of workers at the construction sites. This article, based on a variety of applications of drones in other industrial sectors, considers the use of drones for construction safety improvement in the GCC countries. This article aimed to investigate the safety-related applications of drones considering technical features and barriers and enablers for safety-related tasks. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed research approach using both qualitative and quantitative methods was adopted to achieve the aims and objectives of this research. Data were collected through a systematic literature review, semistructured interviews and using a structured questionnaire. A total of 37 relevant research items and 10 interviews were held with construction safety professionals, and 92 responses collected from the safety managers through a structured questionnaire was used to derive the conclusion of this research. The collected data were processed and analyzed using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) program. Descriptive analyses were carried out in which means and importance factors were calculated. Findings: 25.92% of participants confirmed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. The most common application of drones reported by the respondents was photography for marketing purposes followed by surveying application and quality inspections. The camera movability was the top-rated technical feature required for safety-related inspections. Similarly, “Working near the corner or edge of unprotected opening” was the top-rated application of drone for safety-related tasks. The safety concerns of using drones at job sites were rated as the most important barrier by the participants. Technical challenges associated with the use of drones for safety improvement was rated as the second most important barrier by the participants. Research limitations/implications: Although, the research presented in this article is based on the GCC construction industry, however, since the data collected through systematic review and semistructured interviews are not a regional base, therefore the finding of this research could also be useful in other regions. Further research however, needs to be conducted to reduce the implications of the barriers identified in this paper so that the drone can be effectively used for safety improvement in construction not only in the GCC region but also in other countries. Practical implications: Once the GCC construction industry will be able to overcome the challenges associated with the application of drones in safety improvement, the safety managers will be able to monitor the site more effectively which could be helpful to improve the safety performance of the construction organization. Social implications: Improved safety performance in not only in the greater interest of the construction organizations as they can reduce the costs associated with poor safety but can also avoid the delay caused by construction accidents. Similarly, improved safety performance reduces the accidents at construction sites, and thus reduces injuries and disabilities caused by such accidents, making the construction workers a useful part of the society. The application of drones in safety-related tasks is one of the key solutions that can lead us to improved safety performance. Originality/value: Although, the use of drone technology has revolutionized a number of industrial sectors due to its variety of applications, the application in construction particularly in the GCC region is still very limited. As noted in the results of this research, only 21 participants (25.92%) expressed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. This means that the industry is not getting the full advantage of the available drone technology. The results of this research will enable construction industry stakeholders to know the challenges associated with the application of drones for safety improvement and to develop strategies to overcome these challenges. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction;

Two smart toys (a dog-type robot ""aibo"" and a toy drone) were used for the resting actions. Two types of experiments were conducted to examine the effects: one is a work type experiment (simple mathematical calculation) and the other is a memorizing type experiment (learning of English words). In those experiments, the learners played with one of the smart toys during the resting times between the learning sessions and performed certain actions accordingly. The experimental results were combined with the previous study using a humanoid robot ""RoBoHoN."" A questionnaire was also employed to investigate the feeling of the learners. The experiments showed that the ""playing with aibo"" action refreshed the learners effectively in the mathematical experiment, while the ""playing with RoBoHoN"" action was effective in the learning experiment. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Therefore, conventional sliding mode and fuzzy sliding mode control algorithms are suggested for the stabilization of a multi-input-multi-output nonlinear aeroelastic model. The aerodynamic lift and moment are expressed based on the Wagner's function for unsteady aerodynamics, and the flight dynamic model describes the plunge and pitch motions of the aircraft wing section with trailing- and leading-edge control surfaces. The selected two-degree of freedom model that includes aerodynamic and structural nonlinearities interactions, exhibits instability phenomena such as flutter and Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCOs) beyond a critical free-stream velocity. The contribution of this work is to design control algorithms in order to improve the critical flutter speed for the aeroelastic model in which unsteady aerodynamics is introduced. The control laws permit to drive the plunge displacement and pitch angle trajectories to the origin in finite time, and to guarantee a chattering-free system. The obtained results confirm that the established controllers effectively accomplish suppression of LCOs and lead the state trajectories to the origin despite nonlinearities and gust loads. © 2020 University of Bahrain.

This exploratory and explanatory research has been performed in the context of digitization of Bangladesh economy. The research question is whether the transformation of Bangladesh towards the digital economy can act effectively and efficiently for the benefits of the society and the economy. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted. Sixteen hypotheses were tested based on the Chi-square test. The time period of the study was from April 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. The Chi-square test findings were significant for the following null hypotheses: Internet of Thinking will not bring benefits of the human beings; robots are not needed for industries; big data cannot be used for the business intelligence; artificial intelligence (AI) is not effective; bitcoin transactions should not be allowed; the banking sector is not relatively digitalized; chatbots do not need to be used in banks; drones cannot be used for commercial purpose; robots cannot be used for education purpose; farmers must not learn to yield wirelessly. Another six null hypotheses were rejected. Fear of losing employment was the key obstruction to execute the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) in the country as revealed from the study. Proper information and communication technology (ICT) based education, preparation and knowledge were required. Good governance and regulation should be established with the help of digitization in Bangladesh. The study is suggested to answer the research question, if the benefit from transforming the society to the digital economy may outweigh negative impacts and turn threats into opportunities, reduce demand for labor and disguised unemployment and narrow down the scope of creating new employment opportunities in the country. The potential unlocking system in the global market is feasible through ensuring digitization of Bangladesh society. © 2020 The Author.","Artificial Intelligence; Bangladesh; Digital Economy; Digitization; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Labor Demand; Technological Changes; Telecommunications",,,,,,"University Grants Commission of Bangladesh, UGC

Asian Development Bank, ADB","The digital economy refers to the financial arrangement supported by digital computing skills. Real-time gross settlement in most of the banks in Bangladesh has been working. Comparatively in the financial and the banking sectors, electronic banking and digitization were introduced. However, the cost of e-banking is much higher for lower-and middle-income segments of the society. Bangladesh will start to introduce 5G between 2020 and 2025 in three phases. Nine universities in Bangladesh have been moving to implement advanced ICT education funded by ADB with the help of University Grants Commission (UGC) of Bangladesh. ACI has two apps – Khamari (farming) and Fosali (cropping) for the agriculture sector; through these apps need to be more user-friendly and there should be synchronization between the agricultural production processes to marketing – each stage of these may be more popular. However, government apps on Krishok (farmer) may help to boost up the transparency of the government buying and selling in the agricultural sector. DESHIZ (“Top 8 digital wallets”, 2018) pointed out top 8 digital wallets to go cashless in Bangladesh: bKash, iPay, Rocket, NexusPay, Upay, GPAY, Easy.com.bd, Dmoney. Further, „Digital Haat‟ was introduced in 2020, as the first digital cattle market in Dhaka city.

It was hypothesized that attitude has a positive influence on behavioral intentions, including intentions to use and willingness to pay more. Based on the theoretical relationships, a research model comprising 10 hypotheses are presented and validated by examining a total of 321 samples collected in Korea. Data analysis results indicated that four sub-dimensions of consumer innovativeness, namely, novelty seeking, quality experience seeking, hedonic experience seeking, and social distinctiveness, enhance attitude toward using drone food delivery services. Furthermore, the results showed that attitude plays an important role in the formation of intentions to use and willingness to pay more. © 2020","Attitude; Behavioral intentions; Consumer innovativeness; Drone food delivery services","Technological forecasting; Behavioral intention; Consumer Innovativeness; Food delivery; Novelty seeking; Research models; Willingness to pay; Drones",,,,,"Daegu University, DU","This publication was supported by Daegu University Research Grants in 2017.",,,,"Ajzen, I., From intentions to actions: a theory of planned behavior (1985) Action-control, pp. 11-39. , Springer Berlin, Heidelberg; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organ.

Disruptive technologies include high-tech and emerging technologies such as AI, industry 4.0, IoT, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), big data, virtual reality (VR), Drone technology, and Autonomous Robots, 5 G, and blockchain to offer digital transformation, research and development and service delivery. Disruptive technologies are essential for Industry 4.0 development, which can be applied to many disciplines. In this paper, we present a framework that uses disruptive technologies for COVID-19 analysis. The proposed framework restricts the spread of COVID-19 outbreaks, ensures the safety of the healthcare teams and maintains patients' physical and psychological healthcare conditions. The framework is designed to deal with the severe shortage of PPE for the medical team, reduce the massive pressure on hospitals, and track recovered patients to treat COVID-19 patients with plasma. The study provides oversight for governments on how to adopt technologies to reduce the impact of unprecedented outbreaks for COVID-19. Our work illustrates an empirical case study on the analysis of real COVID-19 patients and shows the importance of the proposed intelligent framework to limit the current outbreaks for COVID-19. The aim is to help the healthcare team make rapid decisions to treat COVID-19 patients in hospitals, home quarantine, or identifying and treating patients with typical cold or flu. © 2020","5 G; Blockchain; Covid-19; Healthcare; Industry 4.0; Internet of medical things (iomt)","Health care; Hospitals; Industrial robots; Industry 4.0; Medical robotics; Metadata; Service industry; Digital transformation; Disruptive technology; Emerging technologies; Empirical case studies; High tech; Medical teams; Research and development; Service delivery; 5G mobile communication systems",,,,,"VCR 0000064","Authors would like to thank Dr. Ahmed Kamal Nabeeh (Medical staff in the corona team of Aljaber Alahmad Alsapah Hospital) for his great support in medical aspects of the COVID-19 regarding the symptoms investigation and results of treatment of the disease.

Importantly, effective coordination and collaboration are facilitated by big data and modern information processing (BDMIP) systems that are complex and interlocked with contemporary information and communication technology (ICT). This study simplifies BDMIP systems by using a comprehensive methodology (literature review and a multi-criteria decision-making approach, called the analytic network process) and explores its key determinants and other interconnected factors. The data were collected from humanitarian managers, working in horizontally (e.g. governments, local and international humanitarian organisations) and vertically (e.g. supply chain partners) collaborated organisations. Three systems (manual, semi-automated, and fully automated) are investigated, which depend on various determinants for operational excellence interlinked with modern big data technology and its components. The results indicate that dynamic compatibility is the most important determinant for such systems to support operational excellence, followed by real-time response, cost, end-to-end visibility, and operational service quality. The implementation of fully automated systems is less cost-effective. This attributes to contemporary dimensions and enablers (e.g. the internet of things, big data collection and analytics, effective data and information sharing, modern unmanned aerial vehicles (called drones), skills for mining structured and unstructured data, among others). Semi-automated systems are also imperative for certain enablers (e.g. data accuracy, data reliability, and personalised data exchange). This study concludes by discussing these findings and their implications for practitioners; how they can combine these technical and operational foundations to execute humanitarian operational excellence and to build effective coordination and collaboration among involved parties. It further provides suggestions for future research. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","analytic network process; big data and information processing systems; Coordination and collaboration; humanitarian operational excellence; ICT and big data applications in humanitarian operations","Advanced Analytics; Antennas; Automation; Big data; Coordination reactions; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Electronic data interchange; Quality of service; Supply chains; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Analytic network process; Dynamic compatibility; Information and Communication Technologies; Information processing systems; Multi criteria decision making; Operational excellence; Semi-automated systems; Supply chain partners; Real time systems",,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, A., Shankar, R., Tiwari, M.K., Modeling the Metrics of Lean, Agile and Leagile Supply Chain: An ANP-Based Approach (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 173 (1), pp. 211-225; Ahmadian, L., Salehi Nejad, S., Khajouei, R., Evaluation Methods Used on Health Information Systems (HISs) in Iran and the Effects of HISs on Iranian Healthcare: A Systematic Review (2015) International Journal of Medical Informatics, 84 (6), pp. 444-453; Akhtar, P., Marr, N.E., Garnevska, E.V., Coordination in Humanitarian Relief Chains: Chain Coordinators (2012) Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management, 2 (1), pp. 85-103; Akhtar, P., Essential Micro‐Foundations for Contemporary Business Operations: Top Management Tangible Competencies, Relationship‐Based Business Networks and Environmental Sustainability (2018) British Journal of Management, 29 (1), pp. 43-63. , Z.

The problem involves finding the shortest path between the delivery points while simultaneously avoiding stationary obstacles (for example high raised buildings) and moving obstacles like other drones. The path needs to be continuously changed based on the telemetry from other drones or based on the addition of new way-points. This is major issue in planning problems. Any algorithm will have to make complex choices like abandoning shortest paths to avoid collisions. In this paper we propose a tangent algorithm which chooses paths based on many performance measures like number of obstacles in current path and the future path and the distance to the next obstacle. The path has very few sharp turns and the locations of these turns are calculated during the path planning. This solves one of the major problems for fast-moving fixed wing systems. The performance evaluation on different environments demonstrates that the algorithm will be particularly faster in case of sparse obstacles since it always starts first by drawing a straight line between way-points and if there are no obstacles in the way then it can exit in a single step. © 2020 MIR Labs.","Autonomous systems; Path planning; Recursive algorithm; Tangent algorithm",,,,,,,,,,,"Lalish, E., Morgansen, K.A., Decentralized reactive collision avoidance for multivehicle systems (2008) Proceedings of the 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, , December; Pallottino, L., Scordio, V.G., Frazzoli, E., Bic-Chi, A., Probabilistic verification of a decentralized policy for conflict resolution in multi-agent systems (2006) Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2448-2453. , May; Samek, J., Sislak, D., Volf, P., Pechoucek, M., Multi-party collision avoidance among unmanned aerial vehicles (2007) In Proceedings of the 2007 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT '07), pp. 403-406. , Czech Technical University in Prague, Tech.

The study used mixed methods with participants limited to those that have effectively implemented some emerging technologies in their recent construction projects. Findings reveal how the combinations of emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), drones, 3 D Laser Scanning, Building Information Modelling (BIM) and others are proving to be useful tools in preventing the occurrence of variation when implemented correctly.

We study a multi-warehouse drone delivery system, considering the allocation rule that all warehouses share the drones and the allocation rule that each warehouse owns its drones. Both plug-in charge and battery swap strategies are investigated for battery management. We examine the random and closest drone to warehouse assignment rules, and design a heuristic to improve the drone to warehouse assignment rule. A closed queueing network is built to estimate the maximum throughput capacity and a cost minimisation model is developed for cost analysis. We validate the analytical model by simulation and conduct numerical experiments to analyse the operating polices. The results show that the closest drone to warehouse assignment rule outperforms the random drone to warehouse assignment rule when the number of drones is not large, and our heuristic can improve the throughput capacity by about 13.31%. The battery swap strategy provides a better throughput capacity than the plug-in charge strategy in most cases, while it needs more investment. Moreover, the shared allocation rule gives a larger throughput capacity than the dedicated allocation rule, and it reduces the operating cost by about 30.70%. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","drone delivery system; logistics; performance analysis; queueing networks","Battery management systems; Cost benefit analysis; Electric batteries; Warehouses; Battery Management; Closed queueing network; Cost minimisation; Delivery systems; Maximum through-put; Numerical experiments; Operating policies; Throughput capacities; Drones",,,,,"2018CFB160

There are more and more cross-regional and multi-disciplinary collaborative design integrate the time, human and other resources to promote more innovation activities. However, there is still a lack of systematic and effective tools to cover the whole process of collaborative design activities. To address this gap, we provide a case example to solve this problem of using online collaboration tools (OCT) in collaborative design context, and further illustrate some implications through the systematic innovation perspective. In the present paper, we discuss how the adoption of online collaboration tools has influenced the collab-orative design activities based on the IDEEA drone design workshop. Discuss the impact of online collaboration tools on the participants' learning and collaboration effect in the distributed systems. Online collaboration tools can be used to access knowledge that originates from external as well as internal sources, but it seems that online tools increase the visibility and accessibility of internal expertise and therefore the use of internal knowledge. The main contributions of this paper include:1) Our research revealed that the online collaboration tools can promote innovative design of multi-disciplinary and innovation design. The design tasks of the workshop are completed by each team with almost no traditional offline collaboration. 2) The implementation of collaborative design is divided into five types according to the design thinking process: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test. Analyzing the attributes of different collaboration tools in the process of innovative design. 3) Discuss from the project what kind of technical methods and tools are suitable for the specific collaborative design system.

This study will clarify that the EU’s regulatory framework covers all types of existing and future drone operations, creating an international market for unmanned aircraft services. This move will facilitate the enforcement of citizen's privacy rights and address security issues and environmental concerns to the benefit of the EU citizens. Moreover, this study will show that national legislators are now faced with the difficult task of replacing their national regulations with EU rules, however these were drafted so fast that they still leave a number of issues to be decided on by national legislators.

They perform tasks repetitively at reasonable cost and quality levels. The main objective of this work is to design and develop healthcare delivery drone. The delivery drone has the potential to have the same effect on traditional transportation infrastructure. Due to poor transportation infrastructure, or roads blocked by severe weather, disasters or traffic congestion, the delivery of small items like medicines, blood and vaccines or other healthcare items that is needed in locations with difficult access becomes critical in healthcare.

Forest monitoring, habitat monitoring, industrial monitoring and structural monitoring are the trending applications in sensor networks. However due to scarcity of limited resources such as memory, transmission range, Bandwidth and Battery power, life time improvement of the sensor network is the major problem facing by the researcher. To get better life time of the sensor network, mobile sink is used in the reserved forest monitoring application. A novel Ant swarm approach is proposed for data aggregation through mobile sink to prolong the life span and reduce the overhead of sensor network. For better enhancement of lifetime of individual entity in the sensor network for forest monitoring, Drones can be used to carry the sink node for data aggregation. Mobile sink node is continuously transmitting the tokens to the sensor node within the coverage area of sink node. Sensor nodes send the sensed data with its node identity after arrival of token message from the sink. When the sink node is out of transmission range from any sensor node then the sensed data is forwarded with neighbor node continuously and check whether the sink node is in transmission range or not. By using the concept of ant line walking, data aggregation is done with minimal overhead and better lifetime improvement in WSN. Simulation results show that the proposed method enhance the network performance in terms of different performance evaluation metrics. The life time is improved with 30 to 40% when compared with various existing mobile sink data aggregation approach. © IJSTR 2020.","Ant Swarm; Data aggregation; Forest monitoring; Mobile sink; Network lifetime; Overhead",,,,,,,,,,,"Paruthi Ilam Vazhuthi, P., Manikandan, S.P., Survey on various modified LEACH hierarchical protocols for wireless sensor networks (2019) Springer Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies, , March; Soni, S., Shrivastava, M., (2018) Novel Learning Algorithms for Efficient Mobile Sink Data Collection Using Reinforcement Learning in Wireless Sensor Network, , Hindawi,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, Volume; Prasanna Lakshmi, A., Vijayakumar, B., Venu Gopal, T., Sridhar, V., An Energy Efficient Ant Based Routing Algorithm For Wireless Sensor Networks (2018) International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 118 (11); Gharaei, N., Bakar, K.A., Hashim, S.Z.M., Pouras, A.H., (2018) Inter-And Intra-Cluster Movement of Mobile Sink Algorithms for Cluster-Based Networks to Enhance the Network Lifetime, , Ad Hoc Networks; Sanuthomas, T., Intelligent Path Discovery for a Mobile Sink in Wireless Sensor Network (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 143, pp. 749-756; Ha, I., Djuraev, M., Ahn, B., An Optimal Data Gathering Method for Mobile Sinks in WSNs (2017) Wireless Personal Communications, 97 (1), pp. 1401-1417. , November; Zungeru, A.M., Ang, L.-M., Prabaharan, S.R.S., Seng, K.P., Ant Based Routing Protocol for Visual Sensors International Conference on Informatics Engineering and Information Science, ICIEIS 2011: Informatics Engineering and Information Science, pp. 250-264; Zungeru, A.M., Seng, K.P., Ang, L.-M., Chong, W., Energy Efficiency Performance Improvements for Ant-Based Routing Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks (2012) Journal of Sensors, 2013. , December; Rault, T., Bouabdallah, A., Challal, Y., Energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks: A top-down survey (2014) Comput Networks, 67, pp. 104-122; Saginbekov, S., Jhumka, A., Many-to-Many Data Aggregation Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks with Two Sinks (2017) Computer Networks, 123, pp. 184-199; Ghosh, N., Banerjee, I., Application of mobile sink in wireless sensor networks (2018) 10Th International Conference on Communication Systems & Networks (COMSNETS); Bouabdellah, K., Houachenoureddine, S., Using Wireless Sensor Networks for Reliable Forest Fires Detection (2013) Procedia Computer Science, 19, pp. 794-801; Sun, Y., Dong, W., Chen, Y., An Improved Routing Algorithm Based on Ant Colony Optimization in Wireless Sensor Networks (2017) IEEE Communications Letters, 21 (6). , June; Fengchao, C., Ronglin, L., Routing-cost and ant routing algorithm in wireless sensor networks (2011) International Journal of Digital Content Technology and Its Applications, 5 (12), pp. 58-69. , November","Paruthi Ilam Vazhuthi, P.; Anna UniversityIndia; email: paruthi.ilaya.raaj@gmail.com",,,"International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research",,,,,22778616,,,,"English","Int.

However, the performance of detecting small-sized pedestrian instances is still not satisfactory, while small pedestrian detection is important for self-driving and drone vision. Therefore, our effort focuses on improving the detection performance of small-sized multispectral pedestrians which are relatively far from the camera. Since existing multispectral pedestrian datasets mainly consider the large size pedestrians of 50 or more pixels in height, we generate a multispectral pedestrian dataset, named HH (Hanyang and Huins), in which the pedestrian height is from 25 to 50 pixels. To balance the trade-off between the detection performance and speed, we investigate a fusion network to combine two single-shot detectors (SSDs) for the fusion of visible and infrared inputs. The proposed fusion network is trained on public KAIST and KAIST + HH datasets, respectively. From the experimental results, we can observe that the detection performance has been improved a lot by incorporating HH dataset into KAIST dataset for training. The network trained by the original KAIST dataset has only 7.40% average precision (AP). However, the results can be significantly improved to 88.32% by using KAIST + HH for training. This indicates that training images have a great impact on detection performance. © 2019, IJSTR.","Index Terms: Fusion network; Infrared; Small-sized pedestrian detection; Visible",,,,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF: 2017-R1D1A1B04-031040

The paper locates governmental PR discourse on drones in the UK since 2013 within the strategic culture associated with the global war on terror. Design/methodology/approach: The project was based upon critical discourse analysis of the UK governmental PR on drones since 2013, examining press releases, opinion articles by ministers, media relations content, parliamentary statements, news content and other related materials. Findings: The analysis led to five discursive themes of persuasive intent in relation to drones being identified, most of which were notably similar to the US governmental discourse on drone policy and deployment. Originality/value: The project contributes a novel interdisciplinary synthesis of the communicative aspects of international relations as theorised in the field of strategic culture with the cultural aspects of the state-level PR in order to explain how PR was used to promote and diffuse a strategic culture in which drones are assumed to be the counter-terrorism measure of choice. The conclusion is that governmental PR discourse combines aspects of colonialism with focus on superior technology, remote control and precision of weapons, generating a military and communicative logic that overwhelms the voices of victims and impedes meaningful discussion on the reality of suffering caused by drone deployments. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Communication management; Drones; Public relations; War",,,,,,,,,,,"Allinson, J., The necropolitics of Drones (2015) International Political Sociology, 9 (2), pp. 113-127; Arbuthnot, J., (2014) Remotely piloted aircraft are key military capability for future, , www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/defence-committee/news/remote-control-rpas-substantive/, House of Commons Defence Committee, Houses of Parliament, London: (accessed, 15 August 2018; (2018) MOD admits civilian died in RAF strike on Islamic State, , www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43977394, 2 May: (accessed, 17 August 2018; Beale, J., (2013) Inside Britain’s military drone base at RAF Waddington, , www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25425711, BBC News, 18 December: (accessed, 12 May 2019; Booth, K., The concept of strategic culture affirmed (1990) Strategic Power, pp. 212-128. , Jacobsen, C.

Learning outcomes: The learning outcomes are to illustrate the concept and features of cost-effective and responsive supply chain, to explain the concept of hub and spoke and milk run methods used for delivery, to identify financial, operational and technological risks, to elaborate the importance of social dimension (behavioral dimension) in any technological change in an organization and to understand the concept of management of change in organizations. Case overview/synopsis: The case deals with a typical challenge of periodical delivery systems, in this case specifically of The Topical, an Indian periodical. The service manager of the company, Sara Jindal, recognized a problem with customer retention. She explored the causes and found that The Topical, a 20-year-old company, was losing its popularity due to the untimely delivery of the magazines. To solve the problem Jindal, tried to gain an understanding of the operational processes and realized that there was no issue in the warehouse regarding inventory control, management or order pickup. However, she found that the magazines were parceled through book post and that there was no tracking policy in the company for the deliveries. Therefore, it was not possible to know whether the magazines got delivered on time. The matter was taken seriously and as a solution, the possibility of integrating drones into the delivery system came up.

One major obstacle to effective waste management is the lack of monitoring sources at the site of pollution. This is primarily due to inaccessibility of the site or the cost involved in monitoring. Due to ineffective monitoring, Municipal solid waste landfill sites (MSWLF) expand rapidly and encroach upon fresh water sources. These landfill sites also pose other hazards such as a fire risks from methane emissions which may subsequently increase particulate matter (PM 2.5) levels in the air. Furthermore, due to the significant growth of industries in and around the major urban centers of India, monitoring the Air quality index (AQI) has become imperative. The AQI readings in most of the major cities in India are biased due to the short ranges of Monitoring stations. With periodic and frequent monitoring of the MSWLF sites and AQI limits, Authorities can undertake more decisive actions to combat pollution. This article reviews the perspective of using an IOT based drone connected to the cloud for effectively monitoring the MSWLF sites and AQI levels very frequently in a short span of time. The suggested drone would have sensors categorized into two sets of components. The components for monitoring the MSWLF site would consist of a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor along with a thermal imaging camera while the AQI monitoring component will include a PM 2.5 sensor along with a gas detection chamber. These two components would be connected to a cloud server and the obtained information would be updated to a crowd sourced database. The obtained data from the landfill monitoring component will be analyzed using suitable machine learning algorithms to prevent events like fire outbreaks from methane emissions, slippage of wastage slopes, expansion of the site from defined limits etc. © IJSTR 2019.","AQI; Drones; IoT; Machine learning; MSWLF; Predictive maintenance",,,,,,,,,,,"Jha, A.K., Sharma, C., Singh, N., Ramesh, R., Purvaja, R., Gupta, P.K., Greenhouse gas emissions from municipal solid waste management in Indian mega-cities: A case study of Chennai landfill sites (2008) Chemosphere, 71 (4). , March; Rawat, M., Singh, U.K., Mishra, A.K., Subramanian, V., Methane emission and heavy metals quantification from selected landfill areas in India (2008) Environmental Monitoring and Assesment, 137. , February; Kurian Joseph, S., Rajendiran, R., Senthilnathan, M.R., Integrated approach to solid waste management in Chennai: An Indian metro city (2012) Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 14 (2). , June; Alvear, O., Zema, N.R., Natalizio, E., Calafate, C.T., (2017) Using Uav-Based Systems to Monitor Air Pollution in Areas with Poor Accessibility, 2017. , Volume; Themelis, N.J., Ulloa, P.A., Methane Generation in Landfills (2007) Renewable Energy, 32 (7). , June; Liua, S., Bareta, F., Abichoub, M., Boudonc, F., Thomasd, S., Zhaoe, K., Fournierf, C., Hemmerlég, M., Benoit de Soland,Estimating wheat green area index from ground-based LiDAR measurement using a 3D canopy structure model (2017) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, Volume, 247. , December; Tiwari, A., Dixit, A., Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Geospatial Technology Pushing the Limits of Development (2015) American Journal of Engineering Research, Volume, 4 (1); Christiansen, M.P., Laursen, M.S., Jorgensen, R.N., Soren Skovsen And Réne Gislum,Designing and Testing a UAV Mapping System for Agricultural Field Surveying (2017) Sensors, , November; Yang, Y., Zheng, Z., Bian, K., Jiang, Y., Song, L., Ha, Z., (2017) Arms: A Fine-Grained 3D AQI Realtime Monitoring System by UAV, , GLOBECOM 2017 – 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference, December; Kolehmainen, M., Martikainen, H., Ruuskanen, J., Neural networks and periodic components used in air quality forecasting (2001) Atmospheric Environment, 35 (5); Comrie, A.C., Comparing Neural Networks and Regression Models for Ozone Forecasting (1997) Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 47 (6); Elangasinghe, M.A., Singhal, N., Dirks, K.N., Salmond, J.A., Development of an ANN–based air pollution forecasting system with explicit knowledge through sensitivity analysis (2014) Atmospheric Pollution Research, 5 (4). , October",,,,"International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research",,,,,22778616,,,,"English","Int.

This method is based only on the chrominance components of the YCbCr color model. To distinguish the fire-region in an image frame of fire video containing the fire region, the difference between Cr and Cb is computed. The difference is enhanced by computing the square of it and then normalize range of difference squared to 0 to 255. It is then binarized at using automatic thresholding method to segment the fire region from the non-fire region. The fire region in the binary is located using the connected component analysis and the region is mapped to the original image frames of the fire video. We have tested the method in the actual fire video and it is found that the method can appropriately locate the fire regions in every image frame of the video.

However, crime targeting the socially vulnerable groups continues to increase. This is because the vulnerable groups have physical and physical weaknesses. Therefore, in order to pursue a safe society, it is necessary to protect the socially vulnerable. In this paper, we utilize the latest trend, drones, to protect against vulnerable groups. That is, we designed a real-time accident prevention solution for the elderly, the disabled, children and women using the drones. Drones’ autonomous flight technology, obstacle detection technology, collision avoidance technology, wireless communication linkage technology, and real time image transmission technology. Through this, we have studied to enable safe activities in the blind spot of CCTV. In this paper, we have identified the problem of crime prevention system using existing CCTV system. To solve this problem, we have developed a safety accident prevention solution using drones. To this end, we designed the drones to enable real-time tracking by applying autonomous flight technology, obstacle avoidance technique, and object tracking technology. In addition, wireless communication between the object and the drone was applied to prevent flight deviation. And, it is designed to link emergency notification service through real-time video transmission during flight. © BEIESP.","Drone; Object recognition; Object tracking; Obstacle avoidance; Real-time safety; Safety prevention system",,,,,,,,,,,"Park, N.J., Kim, M.R., Implementation of load management application system using smart grid privacy policy in energy management service environment (2014) Clust.

If any animal intrusion and fire detection information detected form sensor nodes can be accessed by the administrator at the far distance from the boundary line of forest (BLOF), in the form of meter to meter updates, then, it will be very beneficial for a given village area surrounded by the forest. The Internet of Things (IoT) based layered wireless sensor networks (IoT-BLWSNs) are the best solution for the above presented applications. The IoT-BLWSNs will also be applicable for restricted (hospital, industrial area, animal cage monitoring in zoo etc) and non restricted areas (college and school campus). In the recent years for heterogeneous as well as homogenous layered networks data transmission have been carried out form layers to the cloud in the IoT-BLWSNs. Each sensor nodes within the layer will sense different events in heterogeneous layered networks. For the proposed heterogeneous based layered sensor networks system model, we consider the processing of the data from sensors to the destination will be carried out wirelessly. The received data will get stored into the cloud with the help of Microcontroller at the destination end. Further, a remotely controlled drone will be sent to the corresponding point based on the received location information from the administrator end for the visualization of the intruder.

This ancient design has stood the test of time and has still found favor with not only action cinema, but also the hunting community and the special forces across the world. It is interesting to note that the Far eastern as well as Nordic texts term it as a favorite tool of dragon slayers, it had found major applications in hunting whales, sharks and other edible marine harvests. Certain countries in the northern hemisphere issue crossbow licenses to farmers in ensuring crop protection from vermin as well as harvesting organic meat from any overpopulating species in a given area. Additionally, it has been extensively used to build rope based connectivity using hooks when a huge gap needs to be crossed. It has also evolved as a tool to track oceanic activities by pegging sensors on its tips to etch it on whales and thus gather crucial data as they navigate the sea. This evolution from an armor piercing weapon to a civilian application device goes to the next level when a crossbow bolt is used to gain atmospheric and aerial data without fear of gaseous exhaust or electro-magnetic fields of drones. The next progression may be of ‘Cold launch missiles’ that are nearly undetectable and may change the course of military technology in the times to come. © BEIESP.","Aeronautics; Armor; Aviation; Avionics; Ballistics; Flight path; Force; Kinetic Energy; Penetration; Projectile; Trajectory",,,,,,,,,,,"Peers, C.J., (1996) Imperial Chinese Armies, (2), pp. 590-1260. , AD, Osprey; Hart, V.G., Lewis, M.J.T., The Hatra ballista: A secret weapon of the past?

Agriculture is the backbone of India and being the largest paddy producer in the world. TamilNadu alone contributes at 7% of the overall paddy cultivation. The key aspect of TamilNadu paddy cultivation is 90% of its farmers belong to the small and medium size category. It's important for farmers who are producing paddy to be equipped with the technology advancements in a simple and effective manner to manage better way of irrigation in terms of water management, improving yield and efficient use of fertilizer and pesticides. Due to inherent nature of large area involved and complex eco system involved paddy cultivation have been always posing challenges in new technology adoption in terms of data acquisition, processing and reporting and lacks easy to follow contextual framework technologists to adopt. This paper would discuss on the infrastructure, technology and big data aspects for paddy cultivation by qualitative research methods. The research would involve identification of the appropriate contextual framework through architectural means and algorithm which would help in sensor deployment strategy. At the end the paper would develop a framework for approaching the IoT and Big Data in paddy cultivation. The framework would outline the architecture components, protocols, communication interfaces which could be leveraged for paddy cultivation. Apart from this the framework also discusses the Wireless sensor network deployment and its key aspect such as coverage in the paddy fields. ©BEIESP.","Big Data Framework; Farming; IoT; Paddy cultivation; Sensor Networks; WSN",,,,,,,,,,,"Rajaram, S.B., Iot Based Crop Disease Identification System Using Optimization Techniques (2018) ARPN Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 13 (4), pp. 1392-1395. , Februrary; Floor Brower, P.J., (2016) International Trade and Food Security: The Future of Indian Agriculutre, , Oxfordshire”, UK: CAB Interantional; Srinivasan, N.V.K.Y.S.A.S.G., Providing Smart Agricultural Solutions to Farmer for Better Yielding Using Iot (2017) International Journal of Advanced Science and Engineering Research, 2 (1), pp. 669-675; Rameshs, V., Crop Disease Identification using Embedded Iot System (2018) International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 118 (20), pp. 143-147; Tzounis, N.K.B.C.K.A., Internet of Things in agriculture, recent advances and future challeges (2017) Biosystem Engineering, 164, pp. 31-47; Kumar, Crop Monitoring using Visual Sensors and Iot (2017) SSRG International Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering (SSRG-IJECE), 4 (4), pp. 42-47; Sekhar, J.C., ”Effective use of Bid data Analytics in Crop Planning to Increase Agriculture Protection in India (2018) International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology, 113, pp. 31-40; Liu, X., Applications of Tempreatrure Prediction Based on Neural Network in Intrusion Detection of IOT (2018) Security and Communication Networks, 2018. , C.Z, P.L.Y.B.W.Z.a.R.H, Vols; Simon, K.P.J.S., Wireless Sensor Networks for Paddy Field Crop Monitiring Application in Kuttanad (2012) International Journal of Modern Engineering Research(Ijmer), 2 (4), pp. 2010-2017. , July – Aug; Prem Prakash Jayaraman, A.Y.D.G.A.M.A.Z., Internate of Things Platform for Smortforming Experiences and Lessons learned (2016) Sensors, 16 (1884), pp. 1-17; Glatzeder, B., Geol, V., Muller, A., (2010) Towars a Theory of Thinging, , Berlin: Springer,Berlin, Heidelberg; Lea, P., (2018) Internet of Things for Architects; Kumar, S.S.I., Applications of Sensor Networks for Monitiring of Rice Plants:A Case Staudy; Blum, A., Effective Use of Water(EUW) and notwater-use efficiancy(WUE) is the target of Crop yeild improvement under trought stress (2009) Field, Crops Research, 112, pp. 119-123; Koomey, J.G., Dunham, C., Lutz, J., The effect of efficiency standards on water use and water-heating energy using the U.S.:A detailed end-use treatement (1995) Energy, 20 (7), pp. 627-635; Wang, Y., Zhou, L., Jia, Q., Yu, W., Water use Efficeny of a rice paddy field in Liaohe Delta, North east China (2017) Agricultural Water Management, 187, pp. 222-231; Yunwang, Y.Z.J.R.B., Coverage, Connectivity and development in wireless sensor networks (2015) Recent Develoments in Water Sensor and Ad Hoc Networks, pp. 25-44; Chi-Fu Huang, Y.-C.T., The coverage problem in awireless sensor network (2005) Mobile Network and Applications, 10 (4), pp. 519-528. , Aug; Pinto, A.R., Poehils, L.B., Montez, C., Vargas, F., (2012) Power Optimization for Wireless Sensor Networks, , online]; Zotarelli, M.D.D.A.M.B.L., Minimum no of soil moisture sensors for monitoring and irregation purposes (2013) IFAS Extension, Horticultural Sciences Department, University of Florida, pp. 1-4; Clark, B.N., Colbourn, C.J., Johnson, D.S., Unit disk graphs (1991) Discreate Mathamatics, 86 (1), pp. 165-177; Chantzis, K., Chatzigiannakis, I., Rolim, J.D.P., Design and evaluation of real-time locating sysytem for wireless sensor networks (2014) Journal of Location Based Services, 8 (2), pp. 97-122; Zou, Z., Li, Z.-T., Shen, S., Wang, R., Energy-Efficient data recovery via greedy algorithm for wireless sensor networks (2016) International Journal of Distributor Sensor Networks, 2016 (2), p. 21; Djedouboum, Big Data Collection in Largescale wireless sensor networks (2018) Sensors, pp. 1-34. , 18th Dcecember; Meng, W.D.X.Z.A.J.C.S., KASR: A Keyword –Aware service Recommendation method on Map Reduce for Big Data Applications (2014) IEEE Transection on Parallel and Distributed System, 25 (12), pp. 3221-3231. , December; Raghu Garg, H.A., Big data Analytics Recommendtion Solutions for Crop Desises using Hive and Hadoop Platform (2016) Indian Journal of Sceince and Techonolgy, 9 (32), pp. 1-6. , August; Erten, O.Y.J., Sar algorithmmfor crop height estimation: The paddy-Rice case study (2016) IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (Igarss)Beijing, pp. 7117-7120",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22773878,,,,"English","Int.

Essentially, a drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans in their embedded systems, Flying robots are increasingly adopted in search and rescue missions because of their capability to quickly collect and stream information from remote and dangerous areas. Their maneuverability and hovering capabilities allow them to navigate through complex structures, inspect damaged buildings, and even explore underground tunnels and caves. Since their size is fixed, maneuvering over the compact areas and tunnels of variable size becomes an issue. To overcome this issue, we propose a model of quadrotor design which has the capability to change its size. The arm length of the quadrotor is changed dynamically so that it can fly in areas of variable sizes that would be hard to reach with the quadrotor of fixed arm length. On the other hand, our model is cost-effective, since the arm of the drone is designed with PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride). Using this model, drones will be able to move over compact areas and passages of variable sizes, thus aiding in better exploration during search and rescue operations. © BEIESP.","Aerial Robot; Drone; Quadrotor",,,,,,,,,,,"Falanga, D., Kleber, K., Mintchev, S., Floriano, D., TheFoldable Drone:A Morphing Quadrotor that can squeeze and Fly (2019) IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 4, pp. 209-216; Augustin Manecy, V.R., Viollet, S., Agile robotic fliers: A morphing based approach (2018) Soft Robotics, , Mary Ann Liebert, Inc; Falanga, D., Mueggler, E., Faessler, M., Scaramuzza, D., Aggressive Quadrotor Flight through Narrow Gaps with Onboard Sensing and Computing using Active Vision (2017) International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 5774-5781; Desbiez, A., Expert, F., Boyron, M., Diperi, J., Viollet, S., (2017) X-Morf: A Crash-Separable Quadrotor that Morfs Its X-Geometry in Flight, , RED UAS 2017-Research, Education and Development of Unmanned Aerial Systems, Linkoping, Sweden; Flores, G.R., Escareo, J., Lozano, R., Salazar, S., Quad-tilting rotor convertible MAV: Modeling and real-time hover flight control (2012) J.

There is a huge gap in the availability of micro gas turbine engines in the thrust range of 0.13 to 4.45 kN to power UAVs and drones. This analysis brings out the feasibility of thrust generation in a micro turbojet engine so as to fill the gap. The engine is analyzed for four different mass flow rates, Mach numbers ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 with the operating altitude between 5000 m to 9000 m. The nett thrust produced for a pressure range of 2.5 and is in the range of 3.9 to 4 kN at a mass flow rate of 7.6 kg/s which satisfies the expected design requirement of the engine. Also, the maximum turbine inlet temperature is less than 1000 K so that there is no need for a new material required in the combustor and turbine where the high temperaure exists. The outcomes of this analysis form a strong base for further analysis, design and fabrication of micro gas turbine engines to propel future UAVs and drones. © BEIESP.",,,,,,,"Netherlands Leprosy Relief","The authors wish to thank the support and granted by NLR - Netherlands Aerospace granting the license to use the Gas Turbine Program GSP 11 for carrying the analysis",,,,"Da Silva, J.F., Bringhenti, C., Tomita, J.T., Turbojet Transient Performance Simulation (2013) 22Nd International Congress of Mechanical Engineering, pp. 9748-9759; Kim, S.Y., Soudarev, B., Transient Analysis of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine Engine (2000) KSAS International Journal, 2, pp. 22-29; Gobran, M.H., Off-design performance of solar Centaur-40 gas turbine engine using Simulink (2013) Ain Shams Engineering Journal, 4, pp. 285-298; Kumar, D., Gupta, R.K., Parametric and performance analysis of Turbojet engine through MATLAB (2016) International Journal for Technological Research in Engineering, 3 (10), pp. 2653-2657; Torella, G., Transient Performance and Behaviour of Gas Turbine engines, The Gas turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exposition, Brussels, Belgium, pp (1990) 1-8, June, pp. 11-14; Gilani, S.I.U.H., Baheta, A.T., Majid, M.A.A., Thermodynamics Approach to Determine a Gas Turbine Components Design Data and Scaling Method for Performance Map Generation (2008) 1St International Conference on Plant Equipment and Reliability (ICPER), , Selangor, Malaysia, March 27-28; Ujam, A.J., Parametric analysis of a Turbojet engine with reduced inlet pressure to compressor (2015) IOSR Journal of Engineering, 3 (8), pp. 29-37; Farokhi, S., (2014) Aircraft Propulsion, , Second Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., May; Treager, I.E., (2009) Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine Technology, , Third Edition, Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Company Limited, New Delhi; Saravanamuttoo, H., Cohen, H., Rogers, G.F.C., (2014) Gas Turbine Theory, , Fifth Edition, Pearson; Mattingly, J.D., (2014) Elements of Gas Turbine Propulsion, , Indian Edition, Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Company Limited, New Delhi; Hill, P.G., Peterson, C., (1999) Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Propulsion, , Second Edition, Addison Wesley Longman, Inc; Rangwala, A.S., (2010) Theory and Practice in Gas Turbines, , New Age International (P) Limited; Maitra, G.M., Prasad, L.V., (1985) Handbook of Mechanical Design, , Second Edition, Tata McGraw-Hill",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22773878,,,,"English","Int.

Although different road vehicles (e.g., ambulances) are used for this, with increasing rate of congestion, it is becoming increasingly challenging to perform this task on time. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the applicability of drones in transporting emergency medical products and investigate how different parameters (technical and environmental) that affect the drone flight, contribute to the cost of transportation. A number of ‘to-be scenarios’ have been generated by varying different parameters. Similarly, a case study has been conducted to illustrate the use of different drones on different operational conditions. The outcomes of this study have the potential to help concerned officials make decisions on the feasibility of using drones in transporting emergency medical products, assist policy makers on policy decisions, and contribute to saving the life of victims of traffic accidents.

The R-functions theory allows one to describe geometric objects of a complex shape with a single analytical expression, that is, obtain a mathematical model of the object in a form of an equation. To derive such equations, we used both the well-known standard primitive (sphere, ellipsoid, cylinder, cone, pyramid, etc.) procedure and a new approach, blending on a frame, which enables derivation of multiparameter equations with specified properties. Multiparameter equations of surfaces of drones of various types and purposes have been derived and visualized. Adequacy of the results to the designed objects was confirmed by visualization, both in conditions of operation of the RFPreview program and by realization on a 3D printer. The use of literal parameters when specifying geometric information in an analytical form makes it possible to promptly change size and shape of the designed objects which helps reduce time required to build computational models. The proposed method can reduce labor input in operation of CAD systems by months in cases when it is necessary to view a large number of design variants in a search for an optimal solution. Having the object equation, one can easily obtain equation of any of its sections which is useful for numerical calculations, namely, when building computational meshes. This can have a great effect on reducing complexity in construction of computational models for determining aero-gas-dynamic and strength characteristics. Characterization is also often associated with the need to account for changes in the aircraft shape. This leads to the fact that establishment of aerodynamic characteristics just because of the need to build a large number of computational models to account for this factor increases work duration by months. When specifying parameters, change of the rated operating conditions is made almost instantly. © 2019 Tatyana Sheyko, Kirill Maksimenko-Sheyko, Vladimir Sirenko, Anna Morozova, Roksana Petrova.","3D printer; Blending on a frame; Drone; R-functions; Standard primitive",,,,,,,,,,,"Fedorov, S.I., Haustov, A.V., Kramarenko, T.M., Dolgih, V.S., UAV Classification and Intelligent Management Systems (2016) Otkrytye informacionnye i komp'yuternye integrirovannye tekhnologii, (74), pp. 12-21; Austin, R., (2010) Unmanned Aircraft Systems: UAVS Design, Development and Deployment, p. 332. , https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470664797, John Wiley and Sons; Arjomandi, M., Classification of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (2006) MECH ENG 3016.

For this, a potato crop (Solanum tuberosum) was selected, considering its importance for the national economy and culture, and the metrological and logistical procedures were defined to capture, using a fixed wing drone, high resolution multispectral imagery. To do this two cameras were used, a RGB (visible) and a NIR (Near Infrared), capturing the Blue, Green, Red and IR bands. This set of bands allow us to calculate the Normalized Vegetation Index or NDVI for the potato crop, and, through this index, define the differenced spectral response zones. To determine why there were zones with different spectral response or different NDVI values, a field observation were performed, obtaining that, where the index was medium or low (0.2 to 0.6) existed a problem in the crop health or the presence of another plants like grass or herbaceous, which compete with potato for water and sunlight. The results show that spectral response is a good indicator of vegetation characteristics and potential problems in crops, which make this technology viable as an alternative for monitoring and better planning of agriculture activities. © 2018.El presente trabajo se enfoca a la implementación de la tecnología de VANT (Vehículos aéreos no tripulados) o drones en la agricultura, con el fin de estimar parámetros del cultivo y obtener otra información relevante sobre su estado de salud, en menores tiempos y de forma más eficiente que permitan tomar decisiones que mejoran la rentabilidad de los agricultores. Para esto, se seleccionó un cultivo de interés nacional como es la papa (Solanum tuberosum) y sobre este se realizó el montaje metodológico y logístico para capturar, a través de un dron de ala fija, imágenes multiespectrales de alta resolución. Las imágenes fueron capturadas con dos cámaras, una RGB (Visible) y otra NIR (Infrarrojo cercano), las cuales capturan las bandas Verde-Azul-Rojo y Azul-Verde-IR (Infrarrojo cercano). Esta configuración de bandas permitió calcular el índice de vegetación de diferencia normalizada (NDVI) para el cultivo de papa, y a través del cálculo de este índice se definieron zonas de respuesta espectral diferenciada, las cuales fueron posteriormente verificadas en campo para establecer las causas de dicha respuesta espectral. Se encontró que en zonas de índices medios y bajos (0.2 a 0.6), era evidente algún problema de desarrollo en el cultivo o la presencia de especies invasoras. Los resultados obtenidos demuestran que la respuesta espectral permite identificar características de la vegetación y problemas en el cultivo, de tal forma que se evidencia la viabilidad técnica de esta herramienta tecnológica como alternativa para pequeños y grandes agricultores que permite optimizar el desarrollo de los sistemas productivos. © 2018.","Agricultura de precisión; Drones; Drones; Imágenes multiespectrales; Multispectral imagery; NDVI; NDVI; Near infrared",,,,,,,,,,,"Alzate, D., Rojas, E., Mosquera, J., Ramón, J., Cambio climático y variabilidad climática para el periodo 1981-2010 en las cuencas de los ríos Zulia y Pamplonita, Norte de Santander, Colombia (2015) Rev.

The classification of the organization's employees is given within the framework of the article, assuming such types as: generator; operator; office drones; organizer, freelancer. Various conditions for project implementation are considered, which present the following situations: tasks are distributed only between department employees, with each work performed only by a specific employee; tasks are distributed only between employees of the department, but you can apply the method of teamwork on a specific task; tasks are distributed among employees, and there is also the opportunity to reduce the time of routine work due to the creativity of the generator; use all the possible levers of project management - the generator, freelancers, the joint work of several employees on one task. Based on an assessment of the feasibility of implementing all project tasks, the effect of differences in the different employees' performance during the execution of individual tasks is shown. The levers of project time management are determined - joint work of employees on separate stages, attraction of freelancers, reduction of time for accomplishing tasks. Variant calculations have been carried out, proving the effect of the integrated use of a wide range of levers to shorten the project time. © 2018.","Critical path; Freelancer; Productivity; Project; Terms of the project",,,,,,,,,,,"Anshin, V.M., Demkin, I.V., Nikonov, I.M., Tsarkov, I.N., (2008) Models of projects management in conditions of uncertainty, , Moscow: MATI; Ashmanov, I.S., (2008) Life inside the bubble, , Moscow: Mann.

We can mount these small cameras on several devices, like unmanned air vehicles (UAV) and create 3D models with photogrammetric technique. Either creating or receiving these kind of databases, one of the most important questions will always be that how accurate these systems are, what the accuracy that can be achieved is. We gathered the overlapping images, created point clouds, and then we generated 21 different digital surface models (DSM). The differences based on the number of images we used in each model, and on the flight height. We repeated the flights three times, to compare the same models with each other. Besides, we measured 129 reference points with RTK-GPS, to compare the height differences with the extracted cell values from each DSM. The results showed that higher flight height has lower errors, and the optimal air base distance is one fourth of the flying height in both cases. The lowest median was 0.08 meter, at the 180 meter flight, 50 meter air base distance model. Raising the number of images does not increase the overall accuracy. The connection between the amount of error and distance from the nearest GCP is not linear in every case.","Agisoft photo scan; Airborne imagery; Drone; DSM; Photogrammetry","accuracy assessment; airborne sensing; database; digital terrain model; equipment; error correction; image analysis; numerical model; photogrammetry; three-dimensional modeling; unmanned vehicle; Hungary",,,,,"European Social Fund, ESF

The group investigated the possibilities, risks, and opportunities of using satellites, drones, and high-altitude balloons to provide widespread access to the internet. The group focused on one of the barriers for worldwide connectivity - the lack of economic viability for providing internet access using land infrastructure, and the possible solutions that will address this problem. As a result of these findings, the working group participants proposed several recommendations. These recommendations take into account the numerous challenges that come with developing air- and space-based internet access; whether it be by balloons, drones, satellites, or a combination of these. These challenges range from acquiring regulatory approval to technical and practical limitations, such as the potential for damage to property and issues related to orbital debris. Due to our group's consensus that worldwide internet availability would ultimately be beneficial, given both humanitarian and economic concerns for poor and wealthy nations alike, we propose 4 ""game changing"" ideas that have the potential to positively impact the space economy. We first suggest that market studies be conducted to illustrate demand for the service. With sufficient demand, a phased approach to the solution should then be instituted. We further propose that national governments, which currently are not involved in the projects, serve as anchor tenants and expedite regulatory processes. Finally, to ensure commercial sustainability, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should be considered potential distribution partners for the system. Our article deals with the current status and the future of space-based internet services, and details our recommendations. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","internet providers; space communications; Space Generation Advisory Council; Space Generation Congress; space internet",,,,,,"Hungarian Scientific Research Fund, OTKA

Advantages of these qualitative multistage methods are a simple and easy to understand concept while still delivering valid results [3]. Nevertheless, the literature also points out certain disadvantages especially in large-scale technology forecasts in particularly abstract fields of innovation [4]. The proposed approach highlights the usefulness of the repertory grid method as an alternative for technology forecasting and as a first step for preference measurement. The basic approach from Baier and Kohler [5] is modified in-so-far that an online survey reduces the cognitive burden for the experts and simplifies the data collection process. Advantages over alternative approaches through its simple structure and through combining qualitative and quantitative methods are shown and an adaption on an actual field of innovation – civil drones in Germany – is done. The measurement of a common terminology for all experts minimizes misunderstandings during the interview and the achievement of an inter-individual comparable level of abstraction is forced by the laddering technique [6] during the interview.","Civil drones; Innovative product development; Multistage expert surveys; Qualitative research; Quality requirements; Quantitative research; Repertory grid method; Technology forecasting",,,,,,,,,,,"Cuhls, K., Grupp, H., Blind, K., (1998) Delphi’98 – New Chances by Strategic Foresight [in Germany: Delphi ‘98 – Neue Chancen Durch Strategische Vo-Rausschau], , Karlsruhe: Fraunhofer-Institut für Systemtechnik und Innovationsforschung; Green, K.C., Armstrong, J.S., Graefe, A., Methods to elicit forecasts from groups: Delphi and prediction markets compared (2007) Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting, (8), pp. 17-20; Armstrong, J.S., Green, K.C., Green, H., Green, C., (2015) Select A Forecasting Method (Selection Tree), , http://forecastingprinciples.com/index.php/selection-tree, Retrieved from; (1998) Survey: Study of Global Development of Science and Technology [in Grmany: Delphi’98 Umfrage – Studie Zur Globalen Entwick-Lung Von Wissenschaft und Technik], , ISI, Delphi’98 Karlsruhe: Fraunhofer-Institut für Systemtechnik und Innovationsforschung; Baier, D., Kohler, T., Technology Foresight by Repertory Grid Method: Methodology and Practical Example [in Germany: Technikvorausschau mittels Repertory-Grid-Verfahren: Methodik und Praxis-beispiel] (2002) Technologie-Roadmapping: Zukunftsstrategien Für Technologieunternehmen, pp. 177-192. , Möhrle M.G., Isenmann R.

In this economy which mostly relies on agriculture, farmlands are afflicted with floods one year and drought in another. To balance these, canal systems are already built. Because of the size of the canal network, its periodic monitoring requires huge amount of work and recourses. Our research investigates possibility of aerial monitoring of regional irrigation and drainage canals using drones. Autonomous flying robots are becoming more and more popular in recent years. This is happening because the technology they are based on is getting less expensive, quadcopters have broken into the consumer market, so the manufacturing costs are constantly decreasing. This enables them to be used both in research and in the industry without having to pay huge amounts of money. In this research, a commercially available quadcopter has been used to monitor water canals around the city. By design, the device has a built-in camera and wireless internet capabilities. These allow to take photos, record video and upload them to the controlling device. It is also possible to stream the live video to the device in real time. The controlling device can be a personal computer, a tablet or even a mobile phone. It is planned that the client software be extended with capability to upload video and photos to the cloud for later reference. Also, other sensors can be added to the device, too.","Cloud; Mapping; Monitoring; Quadcopter; Robot; Water",,,,,,,,,,,"Blaschke, T., Object based image analysis for remote sensing (2010) ISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing, 65 (1), pp. 2-16; Dahdouh-Guebas, F., The use of remote sensing and GIS in the sustainable management of tropical coastal ecosystems (2002) Environ.

To help make Grandview's comeback story a reality, Birmingham-based Brasfield & Gorrie, the original project's general contractor, was retained. Contractors would have to perform interior fit-up work in concert with tear-outs of some finished spaces to accommodate the medical specialties of a tertiary care hospital as well as to satisfy building codes that had changed significantly since 2003. By retro-commissioning existing mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems early in the restart phase, contractors confirmed that most installed equipment could serve the repurposed hospital. This process eliminated both uncertainty and potential costs from the project budget. Project team members used building information modeling to digitize original construction drawings while also providing a base for incorporating programming-related layout and system infrastructure changes developed by lead architect ESA Architects of Nashville. Contractors also used drone-mounted cameras to inspect 250,000 sq ft of the hospital's decade-old glass and precast skin exterior to identify areas in need of repair. Despite the unusual set of challenges, the hospital and related projects achieved their expected levels of quality, for a total cost of $280 million.",,"Budget control; Building codes; Contractors; Building Information Model - BIM; Community health; Construction drawings; Digital hospitals; General contractors; Medical specialties; Plumbing Systems; System infrastructure; Hospitals",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"McGraw-Hill Companies",,,,,08919526,,ENRRE,,"English","ENR",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018989797

The Harfang system is operated by three different specialists located into a Ground Control Station. The Pilot Operator controls for the aircraft and sensors, the Imagery Analyst analyses the full motion video in real time and the Tactical Coordinator manages both team and missions. This system is in charge of missions relative to Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) collection. In order to anticipate the development of a specific RPAS operators' career field in the French Air Force, a standardized selection is needed to propose the most appropriate applicants to the training. This selection requires to identify the best predictors for success. We ran two job analyses. The first analysis, directed to the work station, led to describe activities for each of the three specialists. The second analysis, directed to the individual himself, led to collect the level of complexity for required cognitive, psychomotor and interactive-social abilities related to the previously identified activities. Interviews were used to perform the job analysis focused on the work situation, and an adapted version of F-JAS (Fleishman - Job Analysis Survey) was developed to assess levels of abilities required for activities. The whole population of Harfang operators (N = 30) was solicited for the study. Results showed the optimal profile for each specialist in terms of highest assessed abilities for cognitive, psychomotor and interactive-social domain. Thus, the profile of Pilot Operators is focused on cognitive abilities and especially on attentional abilities. The profile of Tactical Coordinators is balanced between cognitive and interactive-social abilities whereas the profile of Imagery Analysts is highly specialized in cognitive abilities. Results are discussed according to the literature. The methodology used in the current study consisted in an adaptation of the F-JAS. The association of abilities to the operators' activities offers the possibility to update or to add some new activities like the armed capability. Another strength of this methodology is the possibility to be applied on other job's in aeronautics. By example, fighter pilots (e.g. Rafale) and airlift pilots (e.g. A400M) could be the next studied populations. In fact, training of RPAS operators as well as training of pilots have to be adaptive to keep connected with both the RPA systems in constant technical evolution and the new generations of aircraft (e.g. glass-cockpit generation).","Abilities; Aeronautics; Job analysis; Military; Selection; Teleoperation",,,,,,,,,,,"Barnes, M.J., Knapp, B.G., Tillman, B.W., Walters, B.A., Velicki, D., (2000) Crew Systems Analysis of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Future Job and Tasking Environments, , (No. ARL-TR-2081).

Personality is believed to affect decisionmaking, problem-solving, conflict management, and stress management. This stems from the assumption that role conflicts and organizational stress are also manifestations of the underlying turbulence of one’s personality predispositions. This paper reports the results of the threephase study conducted in Maruti Udyog Limited to understand the different behaviour patterns in workplace. In phase I, secondary data were collected through organizational stress and work motivation questionnaires, and job satisfaction and role conflict scales. In phase II, Dynamos and Drones were identified. Those scoring low on organizational stress, role conflict, and absenteeism and high scores on work motivation, work performance, and job satisfaction were grouped as Dynamos. On the other hand, those obtaining high scores on organizational stress, role conflict, and absenteeism and low scores on work motivation, work performance, and job satisfaction were categorized as Drones. In phase III, the Edwards’ Personal Preference Schedule was administered to Dynamos and Drones to compare the need orientation of their behaviour. In order to examine the difference between the Dynamos and the Drones on various need orientation of their personality, t-test was conducted. The results reveal the following: The Dynamos are significantly higher on achievement, order, and autonomy compared to the Drones. Dynamos prefer to participate in friendly groups and form strong attachments. Dynamo’s high score on endurance shows that they keep pursuing a job till it is complete. The drones are significantly higher on aggression and heterosexuality resulting in poor interpersonal relationship. There is no difference between the Dynamos and the Drones on deference, exhibition, interception, dominance, abasement, and change. In order to grow and be successful, an organization therefore needs a workforce consisting of more Dynamos. And, to be a dynamo, one should have the need personality orientation of order, endurance, and achievement which accounts for one's desire to give his best, to be successful, plan work, and stick to the job till the end. The author also stresses upon the need orientation of affiliation, succorance, and nurturance which together form the key ingredients for building interpersonally sensitive relationship. © 2007 SAGE Publications.","Achievement; Dynamos and drones; Endurance; Need orientation; Nurturance; Succorance",,,,,,,,,,,"Abraham, R., Organizational Cynicism: Bases and Consequences (2000) Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs, 126 (3), pp. 269-293; Arsenault, A., Dolan, S., The Role of Personality, Occupation and Organization in Understanding the Relationship Between Job Stress, Performance and Absenteeism (1983) Journal of Occupational Psychology, 56 (3), pp. 227-240; Barrick, M.R., Mount, M.K., The Big-Five Personality Dimensions and Job Performance: A Meta-Analysis (1991) Personnel Psychology, 44 (1), pp. 1-26; Bauer, T.N., Green, S.G., Development of Leader-Member Exchange: A Longitudinal Test (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39 (6), pp. 1538-1567; Baute, P., (2000) Using Psychological Screening to Select Top Performers for Firefighting, , http://paschalbaute.com/firefighting.htm; Bernardin, H.J., The Relationship of Personality Variables to Organizational Withdrawal (1977) Personnel Psychology, 30, pp. 17-27; Bouchard, T.J., Personality Problem Solving Procedure and Performance in Small Groups {monograph} (1969) Journal of Applied Psychology, 53 (1), pp. 1-28; Day, D.V., Silverman, S.B., Personality and Job Performance: Evidence of Instrumental Validity (1989) Personnel Psychology, 42 (1), pp. 25-36; Day, D.V., Bedeian, A.G., Personality Similarity and Work-Related Outcomes Among African-American Nursing Personnel: A Test of the Supplementary Model of Person-Environment Congruence (1995) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 46, pp. 55-70; Dayal, I., Saiyadain, M.S., Cross Cultural Studyof Behavior in Groups (1970) Indian Psychological Review, 6 (2), pp. 8-13; Edwards, A.L., (1959) Edwards’ Personal Preference Schedule Manual, , New York: The Psychological Corporation; Fitzgerald, C., Kirby, L.K., (1997) Developing Leaders: Research and Applications in Psychological Type and Leadership Development, pp. 63-114. , Palo Alto CA: Davies Black Publishing; Flett, G.L., Hewitt, P.L., Hallett, C.J., Perfectionism and Job Stress in Teachers (1995) Canadian Journal of School Psychology, 11, pp. 32-42; Ghiselli, E.E., (1971) Explorations in Managerial Talent, , Paci.c Palisades, CA: Goodyear Publishing; Goffin, R.D., Rothstein, M.G., Johnston, N.G., Predicting Job Performance Using Personality Constructs: Are Personality Tests Created Equal?
