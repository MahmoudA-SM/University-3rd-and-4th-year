Reaching a decision on the best decommissioning option for each installation is a complex process, which demands the highest degree of responsibility and care to balance protection of the environment with safety, technological and economic consideration. The practice of maintaining the correlation between the physical plant and its digital twin is known as 'integrated asset management' (IAM). It is suggested that if the process and power industries are to continue to be safe and profitable in an increasingly competitive world, then it is imperative that they begin to invest in the asset that is is plant information.",,Accident prevention; Chemical plants; Decision making; Investments; Mathematical models; Photogrammetry; Polyethylenes; Problem solving; Regulatory compliance; Three dimensional computer graphics; Business models; Chemical storage vessels; Integrated asset management (IAM); Integrated project execution (IPE); Plant shutdowns,,,,,,,,,AVEVAUnited Kingdom,,,,,,,,14689340,,HYENF,,English,Hydrocarbon.

The paradigm for implementing ICME in the design and development of composite air vehicle structures is fundamentally distinct from that for metallic structures. Similarly, critical features of a robust Digital Twin model of an all-composite aircraft related to durability, damage tolerance, structural life prediction, establishment of inspection intervals, repairs, and repair assessments are profoundly different than those required for traditional metallic aircraft. This research aims to identify fundamental concepts necessary to develop and validate high-fidelity and computationally-efficient Digital Twin models for use in the damage tolerance assessment of lightweight composite aerospace structures, where the ""Owl"" all-composite ultra-light unmanned air vehicle (UAV) is used as a candidate proof-of-concept platform. The Owl was originally developed as part of the U.S. Army Space Missile Defense Command High Performance Materials/Processes (HIPERMAP) Program. The vehicle structural design, power plant, and sensor packages were based on next generation sailplane technologies. The vehicle has a 36 ft. wingspan and employs predominately carbon-epoxy construction throughout the wing and fuselage. The Owl may be flown either as a pilot-controlled manned vehicle or as an autonomous UAV. As part of the HIPERMAP Program, two fully functional Owl UAVs were developed, as well as several full-scale structural test articles used in static, dynamic, and ultimate load testing of the wing and fuselage assemblies. The flight vehicles were subjected to a series of instrumented flight tests to establish UAV sensor platform capabilities and initial mission profiles. In addition, highly refined and structurally complete ABAQUS finite element (FE) models of the wing, fuselage, and assembled air vehicle were developed to predict the static and dynamic vehicle response. The FE models account for the composite material stack-up sequence, sandwich construction, ply drop offs, and adhesive bonds throughout the entire air vehicle. The existing Owl FE and outer mold line geometry models will be used to probe essential features associated with enhanced structural, progressive failure, computational fluid dynamics, and loads models necessary to establish an Airframe Digital Twin model.",,All-composite aircraft; Computational materials; Damage tolerance assessment; Design and Development; High performance material; Lightweight composites; Sandwich construction; Unmanned air vehicles; Airframes; Birds; Computational fluid dynamics; Fuselages; Load testing; Repair; Sensors; Structural design; Structural frames; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned vehicles,,,,,,,,"Glaessgan, E.H., Stargel, D.S., The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and U.S. Air force vehicles (2012) The 53rd Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference, , presented at April 23-26, 2012; Tuegel, E.J., Ingraffea, A.R., Eason, T.G., Spottswood, S.M., Reengineering aircraft structural life prediction using a digital twin (2011) International Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 2011 (1), pp. 1-14; (1999) Review of Damage Tolerance for Composite Sandwich Airframe Structures, , Office of Aviation Research.

A skillful reaction of simulated robots to unpredicted contact forces has become an especially stringent necessity to support the development of emerging applications for which a compliant robotic manipulation is indispensable. This paper focuses on the simulation of physics-based virtual testbeds in which simulated robots are made capable of accommodating external forces exerted by the environment on their manipulators. For this, we integrate methods from multi-body dynamics modeling, advanced robotics, and virtual reality to develop a robotics simulation basis that facilitates the employment of compliant robotic manipulations in simulated applications. The validation of this basis in joint space indicates that a physics-based simulation of robots endowed with active physical interaction control can capture and reflect significant effects which characterize the interactive behavior of physical compliant robots.We demonstrate the practical utility of our approach to unlock competitive advantages in fully simulated applications prone to position uncertainty. Furthermore, we show the potential of using compliant digital twins of physical robots to introduce compliant robotic manipulations into real applications. © 2016 IEEE.",,Competition; Flexible manipulators; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Modular robots; Robot applications; Robotics; Robots; Testbeds; Virtual reality; Competitive advantage; Emerging applications; Interactive behavior; Multibody dynamics model; Physical interactions; Physics-based Simulation; Position uncertainties; Robotic manipulation; Manipulators,,,,,,,,"Chung, S.-J., Pollard, N., Predictable behavior during contact simulation: A comparison of selected physics engines (2016) Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds, 27 (3-4), pp. 262-270; (2013) Workshop on Developments of Simulation Tools for Robotics and Biomechanics, , IEEE, ICRA, Karlsruhe, Germany; Dallali, H., Mosadeghzad, M., Medrano-Cerda, G.A., Docquier, N., Kormushev, P., Tsagarakis, N., Li, Z., Caldwell, D., Development of a dynamic simulator for a compliant humanoid robot based on a symbolic multibody approach (2013) Mechatronics (ICM), 2013 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 598-603. , IEEE; Ferraguti, F., Golinelli, N., Secchi, C., Preda, N., Bonfe, M., A component-based software architecture for control and simulation of robotic manipulators (2013) Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA), 2013 IEEE 18th Conference on, pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Ferretti, G., Magnani, G., Porrati, P., Rizzi, G., Rocco, P., Rusconi, A., Real-time simulation of a space robotic arm (2008) IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent RObots and Systems; Stanisic, R.Z., Fernández, Á.V., Adjusting the parameters of the mechanical impedance for velocity, impact and force control (2012) Robotica, 30 (4), pp. 583-597; Rossmann, J., Erobotics: The symbiosis of advanced robotics and virtual reality technologies Proc. of ASME 2012 Intern.

Besides forecasting a machine’s life expectancy, the virtual models allow GE to optimize the operation of its products. GE says digital twins are increasing the amount of electricity wind farms produce by as much as 20 percent and reducing annual fuel consumption and carbon emissions for one of its locomotives by 32,000 gallons and 174,000 tons a year, respectively. The technology depends on artificial intelligence to continually update itself. What’s more, if data is corrupted or missing, the company fills in the gaps with the aid of machine learning, a type of AI that lets computers learn without being explicitly programmed. To develop and work with these systems, GE researchers need to understand both the physics of the machines and the AI algorithms.

This is being driven, in part, by the increase in availability of natural gas derived from shale gas and the reduction in global natural gas prices. In parallel, there is a second trend; a shift of new gas turbines installations to higher efficiency F and HA-class gas turbine combined cycle platforms. Supporting these industry trends, GE's DLN 2.6+ combustion system, which is available for the 7F, 9F, 7HA, and 9HA gas turbines offers a high degree of operational and fuel flexibility. The latest evolution of this combustion technology for GE's 7F gas turbines has been commissioned on 25 units, including new units and upgrades to existing turbines. The increased fuel and operational flexibility of this system is aided by GE's advanced control systems that includes a high fidelity digital twin. This paper details recent developments of the DLN 2.6+ combustion system as well as validation examples for both the DLN 2.6+ and the digital twin controls system. © 2017 ASME.",,Combustion; Fuel systems; Fuels; Gases; Natural gas; Shale; Turbomachinery; Advanced control systems; Combustion systems; Combustion technology; Fuel flexibility; Gas turbine combined cycle; Higher efficiency; Natural gas price; Operational flexibility; Gas turbines,,,,,,,,"(1980) McCoy Power Reports, , Gas Turbines; Liquefied Natural Gas: Understanding the Basic Facts (2005), p. 15. , http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/LNG_primerupd.pdf, US Department of Energy, DOE/FE-0489; (2006) Standards for Performance of Combustion Turbines, p. 38505. , Final Rule, Federal Register, 40 CFR 60, Part III Environmental Protection Agency July 6; (2012) European Union (Large Combustion Plants) Regulations, , Statutory Instruments, S.I 566 of 2012; Goldmeer, J., Garcia, E., Rhymer, G., (2016) Powering the Future: U.S. Virgin Islands Fuel Conversion, , Power-Gen International, Orlando, FL; Green duba project true milestone for Saudi Arabia (2015) Arab News, , http://www.arabnews.com/economy/news/684431, January 5; Goldmeer, J., Rojas, T., Burning a mixture of H2 and natural gas (2012) Turbomachinery International, 53 (1), p. 24; Goldmeer, J., Symonds, R., (2014) Evaluation of Arabian Super Light Crude Oil for Use in A F-class DLN Combustion System, , ASME paper GT2014-25351; Goldmeer, J., Gas turbine fuel evaluation process: A case study on the application of arabian super light crude oil for use in ge 7f-class dry low nox (dln) combustion systems (2014) Power Gen International; Goldmeer, J., Bartle, J., Peever, S., Enabling ethane as a primary gas turbine fuel: An economic benefit from the growth of shale gas (2015) PowerGen International; Davis, B., (1996) Dry Low NOx Combustion Systems for GE Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines, , ASME paper 96-GT-027; Vandervort, C., 9 ppm nox /co combustion system for f class industrial (2001) Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power, 123, pp. 317-321; Johnson, C., Pepperman, B., (2008) Ultra Low NOx Combustion Technology, , Power-Gen International, Orlando, FL; Gruschka, U., (2008) ULN System for the New SGT5-8000H Gas Turbine: Design and High Pressure Rig Test Results, , ASME paper, GT2008-51208; Herda, V., Gallagher, W., McQuiggan, G., (2010) The Development and Operational Experience with the Latest Siemens SGT6-5000F Gas Turbine at the Great River Energy Elk River Peaking Plant, , ASME paper GT2010-22091; Ito, E., (2010) Development of Key Technologies for the Next Generation Gas Turbine, , ASME paper GT2010-23233; Ai, T., Masadi, J., Ito, E., Development of the high efficiency and flexible gas turbine m701f5 by applying (2014) J Class Gas Turbine Technologies, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Technical Review, 51 (1); (2016) World Total Natural Gas Production by Region, International Energy Outlook, , US Energy Information Agency; World LNG Estimated Landed Prices, US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC, , https://www.ferc.gov/market-oversight/mktgas/overview/ngas-ovr-lng-wld-pr-est.pdf; Spot LNG Price Statistics, Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, , http://www.meti.go.jp/english/statistics/sho/slng/; Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices, , https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdm.htm, US Energy information Agency; (2015) Electricity from Natural Gas Surpasses Coal for First Time, but Just for One Month, , https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=22312, US Energy Information Agency July; (2016) Natural Gas-fired Electricity Generation Expected to Reach Record Level in, , US Energy Information Agency, July 2016; Natural Gas Gross Withdrawals and Production, , http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_prod_sum_dc_NUS_mmcf_a.htm, US Energy Information administration; Shale Gas in the US, , https://www.eia.gov/energy_in_brief/article/shale_in_the_united_states.cfm, US Energy Information Agency; World Shale Resource Assessment, , http://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/, US Energy Information Administration; Eni Discovers A Supergiant Gas Field in the Egyptian Offshore, , www.eni.com, the largest ever found in the Mediterranean Sea; Burrus, R., Ryder, R., (2003) Composition of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Produced from 14 Wells in the Lower Silurian ""clinton, , https://pubsusgs.gov/pp/1708/g6/pdf/pp1708_g6.pdf, sandstone and Medina Group, northeastern Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania"", U.S. Department of Interior.

Many countries are competing to innovate their manufacturing chains for eco-friendly and energy-efficient productions. Although this green or sustainable manufacturing system evolves under the support of cyber-physical system (or digital twin) based on ICT technology, industrial robots also play important roles in this speedy, flexible and effective manufacturing chains. Recently, low-cost industrial robots or collaborative robots, are rising in a highly interactive environment with humans. Although an industrial robot consists of many important components such as mechanical parts (kinematic structure and reducer) and electric parts (servo motor, driver, sensors, and controller), precision reducer takes approximately 25% of material-cost and governs important performance indices of industrial robots. This paper presents review of high precision reducers (HPRs) for industrial robots driving 4th industrial revolution. First, we provide HPRs market along with industrial robots. According to previous studies, HPRs for industrial robots can be classified based on their principles: planetary reducer, cycloid reducer, and harmonic drive (HD). Then, principle, characteristics, and three main performances (hysteresis, rotational transmission error (RTE) and efficiency) of HPRs are discussed. In addition, compensation methods overcoming accuracy limits of HPRs are summarized. Finally, other applications of HPRs except industrial robots are presented. © 2018, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.",High precision reducers; Industrial robot; The 4th industrial revolution,Chains;

Energy saving of IRs therefore is in great demand for environment protection and enterprise cost reduction, and the energy modeling of IRs is the basis to achieve such goal. In this paper, a novel energy modeling method of IRs based on digital twin is proposed and the system framework is established, which mainly includes the physics-based energy model of the physical IRs, the 3D virtual robot model used to visualize and simulate on the energy consumption of IRs, the digital twin data and the ontology-based unified digitized description model for mapping the virtual model to the corresponding physical energy model. Furthermore, the mapping relation between the physical data and ontology attributes is established to enable the interaction between the physical space and the cyber space of the whole system. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by a case study, and the results show that the digital twin-based energy modeling method can be efficiently used for the simulation and prediction of the energy consumption of IRs. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Digital twin; Energy modeling; Industrial robots; Unified digitized description,Cost reduction; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Mapping; Ontology; Description model; Digital twin; Energy model; Environment protection; Manufacturing process; Robotic technologies; Unified digitized description; Virtual modeling; Industrial robots,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/N018524/1; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51775399; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities: 2018III034GX","Acknowledgment.

This investigation includes transient flow of the liquid - blood and dynamics of zones of shear stress at vessels. The main goal of the research is obtaining of hemodynamic and shear stress for creating the digital twin of coronary heart vessels. The results were obtained for low Reynolds numbers about 20 of three-dimensional laminar flow. With this Reynolds number the turbulent flow of the blood is modelled by Realizable k-ϵ model, and SST models to the narrowing, expansions, and blocks inside the vessels. Loads caused by the additional energy consumption because of the turbulent flow of the blood (increase in arterial blood pressure) have been analyzed. A two-dimensional model of a separated vessel with fixed blood back-flow prevention is developed. Presence of a turbulent flow core is discovered. By the means of stress-strain properties of the model, visual representation of the wearing process of the blood back-flow preventer, and heart diseases progression is obtained. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,Blood pressure; Energy utilization; Heart; Laminar flow; Manufacture; Numerical methods; Reynolds number; Shear flow; Shear stress; Turbulent flow; Arterial blood pressure; Computational model; Low Reynolds number; Stress-strain property; Three-dimensional laminar flows; Two dimensional model; Visual representations; Wearing process; Blood vessels,,,,,,,,"Boschert, S., Rosen, R., (2016) Mechatronic Futures: Challenges and Solutions for Mechatronic Systems and Their Designers, pp. 59-74. , Springer International Publishing; Tuegel, E.J., Ingraffea, A.R., Eason, T.G., Spottswood, S.M., (2011) International Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 2011; Ramtilak, A., Joseph, A., Sivakumar, G., Bhat, S., (2005) SAE Technical Paper No 2005-26-008; Pashchenko, D., (2017) International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 42, pp. 14926-14935; https://www.ansys.com/about-ansys/advantage-magazine/volume-xi-issue-1-2017/creating-a-digital-twin-for-a-pump, date of circulation on 01.02.18; Glaessgen, E., Stargel, D., (2012) 53rd AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference 20th AIAA/ASME/AHS Adaptive Structures Conference 14th AIAA, 1818; Uchida, I.A., Rowe, R.D., (1957) American Journal of Human Genetics, 9, p. 133; Tomar, D., Agarwal, S., (2014) International Journal of Bio-Science and Bio-Technology, 6, pp. 69-82; Schleich, B., (2017) CIRP Annals, 66, pp. 141-144; Cao, X., Wang, J., Wang, R., Zhang, J.X., (2015) Tang Journal of Tsinghua University (Science and Technology), 54, pp. 700-705; Giannoglou, G., Soulis, J.V., Fytanidis, D.K., (2010) Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine (ITAB), 10, pp. 1-4; Ansys Fluent 14.0: Theory Guide (Date of Circulation 29.08.17 Γ.); Popel, A.S., Johnson, P.C., (2005) Annu.

Ever-increasing system design complexity also increased the necessity for more stringent testing and integration capabilities of these new topologies. Real-time simulators can be very useful tools to test, validate and integrate these complex devices. Maintenance and subsystem upgrades, common issues in such complex systems, cannot be easily done on the real systems, especially on larger systems like those in navy ships. This is when a real-time digital replica with Hardware-In-the-Loop capability is very useful. This type of system is also known as a 'Digital Twin'. This approach is compatible with model-based design; a design philosophy that is based entirely on simulation models, from the specifications to release and field commissioning. In this paper, we describe the Digital Twin approach and explain it in the context of navy ships. Such systems usually integrate many subsystems, such as traction systems, power generation and auxiliary systems, all connected through various communication links. The test and integration requirements for such vehicle or land systems affect several levels of the control hierarchy; from low-level power electronic converters used for propulsion and auxiliary systems to high-level supervisory controls. In this paper, we will describe a HIL test made on a simplified zonal power system of a navy ship. © 2018 IEEE.",,Auxiliary equipment; Embedded systems; Hardware; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Integration; Power converters; Power electronics; Ship propulsion; Synthetic apertures; Warships; Hard-ware-in-the-loop; Hardware-in-the-loop testing; Integration capability; Integration requirements; Model- based designs; Power electronic converters; Real time simulators; System design complexity; Integration testing,,,,,,,,"Boldea, I., Nasar, S.A., Electric Drives, , CRC Press; Dommel, H.W., (1992) EMTP Theory Book 2nd Edition, MicroTran Power Analysis Corporation, , May; Terwiesch, P., Keller, T., Scheiben, E., Rail vehicle control system integration testing using digital hardware-in-the-loop simulation (1999) IEEE Trans. on Control Systems Technology, 7 (3). , May; Dufour, C., Mahseredjian, J., Bélanger, J., A combined statespace nodal method for the simulation of power system transients (2011) IEEE Trans. on Power Delivery, 26 (2), pp. 928-935. , April; Dufour, C., Bélanger, J., Real-time simulation technologies in engineering (2015) Chapter of the Book Transient Analysis of Power Systems: Solution Techniques, Tools and Applications, , Juan A.

In contrast to this static application of CPS technology, research conducted jointly by U.S. Department of Energy's, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and Ames Laboratory proposes a new paradigm in which CPS is used as a core technology in energy system development, design, and deployment. The goal is to speed up the development and deployment of advanced concept power plants, reduce the cost and thereby encouraging private and public investment, and substantially reduce the risk of failure. The current technology development paradigm generally starts with models and bench-scale tests, leading to a pilot plant demonstration of the technology before construction of a commercial system. The concept proposed by NETL and Ames incorporates CPS before and during the construction of a pilot plant-arguably the highest risk part of implementing new energy technologies-and then extends the cyber physical infrastructure to the full-scale plant creating a fully functional and coupled digital twin. The creation of a cyber-physical platform as a part of the advanced energy system design and deployment has the potential to enable the ""customization"" of energy systems to meet local needs and resources. This will reduce cost and environmental impact of energy production and use. Examples of how the technology development process can be changed in the energy sector will be discussed using fuel cell turbine hybrids as an example. © 2018 ASME.",Chemical looping; Cyber-physical model; Fluidization; Loop-seal; Observer; Process control,Balancing; Boilers; Combustion; Cost reduction; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Energy policy; Fluidization; Fuel cells; Materials handling; Pilot plants; Process control; Renewable energy resources; SCADA systems; Smart power grids; Sustainable development; Turbines; Waste heat; Chemical looping; Cyber physicals; Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Loop seal; National Energy Technology Laboratory; Observer; Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems; U.S. Department of Energy; Investments,,,,,"Office of Fossil Energy, FE","This work was funded by the U.S Department of Energy Crosscutting Research program, implemented through the Technology Development & Integration Center, Coal, in The Office of Fossil Energy.",,"Kelemenová, T., Kelemen, M., Miková, L., Maxim, V., Prada, E., Lipták, T., Menda, F., Model based design and HIL simulations (2013) American Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 1 (7), pp. 276-281; Model-in-the-loop testing (2006) Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part I: Journal of Systems and Control Engineering, 220, pp. 183-199. , May 1; Debibi, R., Ibrahim, H., Belmokhtar, K., Ilinca, A., Rousse, D., Chandra, A., Ramdenee, D., Ben Arfi, A., Analysis of a micro-grid behavior by a supervisory control and data acquisition system-experimental validation 2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE), , 978-1-4673-8721; Chen, B., Matthews, P.C., Tavner, P.J., Automated on-line fault prognosis for wind turbine pitch systems using supervisory control and data acquisition (2015) IET Renewable Power Generation, 9 (5), pp. 503-513; (2016) A 21st Century Cyber-Physical Systems Education, , Washington, DC: The National Academies Press; Sztipanovits, J., Hemingway, G., Bose, A., Srivastava, A., Model based integration technology for next generation electric grid simulations Proceeding of the IEEE Power and Energy Society Meeting, , 978-1-4673-2729-9/2012; Della Vedova, M.L., Di Palma, E., Facchinetti, T., Electric Load As Real-Time Tasks: An Application of Real-time Physical Systems, , 978-1-4577-9538-2/2011; Gunes, P.S., Givargis, T., Vahid, F., A survey on concepts, applications, and challenges in cyber-physical systems (2014) KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, 8 (12), p. 134. , December 31; Malinowski, H.Y., Comparison of embedded system design for industrial applications (2011) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 7 (2). , MAY; Ordonez, M., Sonnaillon, M.O., Quaicoe, J.E., Iqbal, M.T., An embedded frequency response analyzer for fuel cell monitoring and characterization (2010) IEEE Trans.

By utilizing the digital twins (DT) model, the inverter can be replaced, which is able to be as the substitution to simulate the operation of the inverter. The paper can be arranged as two parts: First of all, the modelling of the inverter in electromechanical transient will be illustrated. Afterwards, the proposed methods are clarified, which are, firstly, an online PI tuner for the controllers of the inverter and then an neural network based identifier is operated to approximate the nonlinear functional dynamic state of it. The design of PI tuner is based on the deviation between the output of the model and the reference output from measurement data. Then, according to the difference, the tuner can calculate the appropriate parameter of the current and voltage controller to track the dynamic behaviour of the reference model. The NN identifier is, however, to replicate the dynamic character of the reference model by NN which is initially trained offline with extensive test data and afterwards is applied to online tuning. © 2019 IEEE.",digital twins; neural network; NN identifier; PI tuner,Electric power transmission networks; Neural networks; Smart power grids; Tuners; Tuning; digital twins; Dynamic behaviours; Dynamic character; Electromechanical transients; NN identifier; Power distribution grids; Reference modeling; Voltage controllers; Electric inverters,,,,,,,,"Liu, A.Y., Lan, P.H., Lin, H.H., An IEEE 1547-based power conditioner test system for distributed energy resources (2013) EPE, 5 (4), pp. 945-949; Yang, T., Development of Dynamic Phasors for the Modelling of Aircraft Electrical Power Systems, , Ph.D. dissertation, University of Nottingham; Hauer, I., Naumann, A., Stotzer, M., Styczynski, Z.A., Communication interface requirements during critical situations in a Smart Grid (2012) 2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe), pp. 1-7. , Berlin, Germany; Motoyama, M., Erratum to ""improving the power generation performance of a solar tower using thermal updraft wind"" [Energy and Power Engineering Vol. 6 No. 11 (October 2014) 362-370] (2015) EPE, 7 (6), pp. 255-257; Jenni, F., Wüest, D., (1995) Steuerverfahren für Selbstgeführte Stromrichter, , Zürich, Stuttgart: Vdf, Hochsch.-Verl. an der ETH Zürich; Teubner; Biesinger, F., Meike, D., Kras, B., Weyrich, M., A case study for a digital twin of body-in-white production systems general concept for automated updating of planning projects in the digital factory (2018) 2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), pp. 19-26. , Turin, Sep. 2018-Sep; Biesinger, F., Meike, D., Krass, B., Weyrich, M., A digital twin for the production planning based on cyber-physiscal systems (2018) CIRP ICME 18-12th CIRP Conference on Intelligent Computation in Manufacturing Engineering; Rosen, R., Von Wichert, G., Lo, G., Bettenhausen, K.D., (2015) About the Importance of Autonomy and Digital Twins for the Future of Manufacturing, pp. 567-572. , ScienceDirect; IF AC Papers Online CONFERENCE PAPER ARCHIVE; Haykin, S.S., (1999) Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation/Simon Haykin, , 2nd ed.

Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of 'new' buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings. Based on the case study in the UK, it can be affirmed that the suitable NZEB solution for an existing building can achieve the 23 year return period. © 2018 by the authors.",Building Information Model (BIM); Energy saving; Green Building; Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB); Sustainability,building; demand analysis; feasibility study; fossil fuel; literature review; numerical model; residential energy; stakeholder; sustainability; visualization; United Kingdom,,,,,"691135; European Commission, EC; Australian Academy of Science; African Academy of Sciences, AAS","Acknowledgments: The first author is grateful to Australian Academy of Science (AAS) and Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences (JSPS) for his JSPS Invitation Fellowship for Research (Long-term), Grant No. JSPS-L15701, at Railway Technical Research Institute (RTRI) and the University of Tokyo, Japan.

Computational modelling is a powerful tool for energy analysis within the manufacturing industry as an effective decision making technique in order to optimise throughput, effectively plan and manage operations, reduce bottlenecks and test various scenarios. This study reviewed methodologies and frameworks developed for analysing energy consumption on a machine process level. Multi-level holistic analysis allowing for consideration of individual machines, the manufacturing process chain and built environment, with both discrete event and continuous based simulation are also presented. The requirement of a complete, high accuracy computational model is highlighted in order to understand the interaction between all relevant material, energy and resource flows. Challenges associated with achieving a holistic simulation of the manufacturing facility with all relevant parameters is presented, along with areas for further development. Furthermore, the development of Industry 4.0 is reviewed, along with new and emerging technologies allowing for increased automation, connectivity and flexibility within manufacturing, as well as visual techniques to provide further understanding and clarity of manufacturing processes such as digital twins, virtual and augmented reality. © 2019",Digital twinning; Discrete event simulation; Energy modelling; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing energy analysis,Augmented reality; Computation theory; Computer aided software engineering; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Industry 4.0; Throughput; Energy analysis; Energy modelling; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing process chain; Reduce energy consumption; Reducing energy consumption; Virtual and augmented reality; Discrete event simulation,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; University of Sheffield",The authors would like to acknowledge the financial contribution provided by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Industrial Doctorial Training Centre (IDC) of Machining Science at the University of Sheffield that has enabled the production of this paper.,,"International Energy Outlook 2017 (2017), U.S. Energy Inf.

The line was instrumented with multiple sensors for measuring machine-wise activity and energy consumption. A software platform for data aggregation and a discrete-event digital twin of the line were built entirely using open-source tools. Based on the insights gained from data collected over several days, we propose a buffering-based solution for improving the energy efficiency of the line, and evaluate its impact using simulations of the digital twin. The results show that a 2.7x reduction in the energy consumption is possible via buffer insertion without significantly affecting line throughput. © 2018 IEEE.",Digital Twin; Internet-of-Things; Manufacturing,Assembly; Assembly machines; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Manufacture; Open source software; Open systems; Organic pollutants; Printed circuit manufacture; Surface mount technology; Buffer insertion; Data aggregation; Digital Twin; Energy optimization; Measuring machines; Multiple sensors; Open source tools; Software platforms; Printed circuit boards,,,,,"13; Ministry of Human Resource Development, MHRD","This work is supported in part by the UAY scheme (project no. 13) by MHRD, Govt. of India, in collaboration with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and in part by the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems.

In the present work, a digital twin for grinding wheel as a product integrated and web-based knowledge sharing platform is developed. It integrates the data collected in each phase of the grinding wheel from the manufacturing to the conditioning phase. The developed digital twin is implemented on the surface grinding machine. The methods for the abstraction of the production information from the manufacturer and the process information while grinding are presented. The development of a predictive model for redress life identification and computation of dressing interim period using spindle motor current data is developed and integrated. The quantifiable benefits from the digital twin for productivity and efficiency are discussed through a case study. The case study scenario evident that the implementation of the digital twin for grinding wheels increases energy and resource efficiency by 14.4%. This clearly depicts the usefulness of the digital twin for energy and resource efficiency toward the sustainable grinding process.

Not only does the enhancement of process and systematic efficiency secure sustainability through increased energy efficiency but it also improves the efficiency in terms of overall productivity. Dyeing and finishing industries consume massive amounts of energy and have large energy-related expenditures. The industry comprises small- and medium-sized enterprises, which have insufficient capital to pay for the energy-efficient equipment. This study proposes a service-oriented platform that can achieve process and systematic efficiency enhancement based on the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The platform reflects the requirements of dyeing and finishing shops in the industry and secures effective interoperability and services using a service-oriented architectural design. A smart operation enabled by the service-oriented platform to improve the efficiency of traditional processes is developed. The system architecture, P4R data model, and service composition are discussed to understand the proposed process. Results suggest that it is possible to provide dyeing and finishing shops with services for reducing energy costs and improving productivity. The proposed platform also provides high-level services that utilize analytical techniques and data from the IIoT, and it serves as a suitable solution for small- and medium-sized enterprises by reducing costs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Digital twin; dyeing and finishing shop; energy efficiency; industrial Internet of Things; service-oriented architecture; sustainable manufacturing,Architecture; Cost reduction; Dyeing; Energy efficiency; Information services; Internet of things; Interoperability; Productivity; Sustainable development; Digital twin; Efficiency enhancement; Energy efficient equipment; Finishing shops; Manufacturing industries; Small and medium sized enterprise; Sustainable manufacturing; System architectures; Service oriented architecture (SOA),,,,,"Ministry of Knowledge Economy, MKE: 20162020108180; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE: N0002601; Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology, KEIT; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning, KETEP","This work was supported by the Energy Efficiency & Resources grant of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) funded by the Korean Ministry of Knowledge Economy [20162020108180] and Virtual Engineering Platform Construction grant of the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy [N0002601].",,"Alam, K.M., El Saddik, A., C2ps: A Digital Twin Architecture Reference Model for the Cloud-Based Cyber-Physical Systems (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 2050-2062; Atzori, L., Iera, A., Giacomo, M., The Internet of Things: A Survey (2010) Computer Networks, 54 (15), pp. 2787-2805; Bisschops, I., Spanjers, H., Literature Review on Textile Wastewater Characterisation (2003) Environmental Technology, 24 (11), pp. 1399-1411; Boschert, S., Rosen, R., Digital Twin—The Simulation Aspect (2016) Mechatronic Futures, pp. 59-74. , Cham: Springer, and; Bustillo, A., López de Lacalle, L.N., Fernández-Valdivielso, A., Santos, P., Data-Mining Modeling for the Prediction of Wear on Forming-Taps in the Threading of Steel Components (2016) Journal of Computational Design and Engineering, 3 (4), pp. 337-348; Chen, K.J., Ji, P., A Genetic Algorithm for Dynamic Advanced Planning and Scheduling (DAPS) with A Frozen Interval (2007) Expert Systems with Applications, 33, pp. 1004-1010; Cheng, Y., Zhang, Y., Ji, P., Xu, W., Zhou, Z., Tao, F., Cyber-Physical Integration for Moving Digital Factories Forward Towards Smart Manufacturing: A Survey (2018) The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 97, pp. 1209-1221; Da Xu, L., and, H., Li, S., Internet of things in industries (2014) A survey, , IEEE Transactions on industrial informatics 10(4): 2233–2243; Deb, K., Pratap, A., Agarwal, S., Meyarivan, T.A.M.T., A Fast and Elitist Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm: NSGA-II (2002) IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6 (2), pp. 182-197; Dornfeld, D.A., Moving Towards Green and Sustainable Manufacturing (2014) International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing-Green Technology, 1 (1), pp. 63-66; Farhan, L., Kharel, R., Kaiwartya, O., Hammoudeh, M., Adebisi, B., Towards Green Computing for Internet of Things: Energy Oriented Path and Message Scheduling Approach (2018) Sustainable Cities and Society, 38, pp. 195-204; Gabor, T., Belzner, L., Kiermeier, M., Beck, M.T., Neitz, A., A Simulation-Based Architecture for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (2016) 2016 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC), pp. 374-379. , –,.

The rapid development of sensing technologies can collect real-time production data from shop floors, which provides more opportunities for making energy saving decisions about manufacturing systems. In this paper, a digital twin-based bidirectional operation framework is proposed to realize energy-efficient manufacturing systems. The data view, model view, and service view of a digital twin manufacturing system are formulated to describe the physical systems in virtual space, to perform simulation analysis, to make decisions, and to control the physical systems for various energy-saving purposes. For online energy-saving decisions about machines in serial manufacturing systems, an event-driven estimation method of an energy-saving window based on Max-plus Algebra is presented to put the target machine to sleep, considering real-time production data of a system segment. A practical, simplified automotive production line is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by simulation experiments. Our method has no restriction on machine failure mode and predefined parameters for energy-saving decision of machines. The proposed approach has potential use in synchronous and asynchronous manufacturing systems. © 2019 by the authors.",Digital twin; Energy efficient operation; Manufacturing system; MATLAB-Simulink; Max-plus Algebra; Stochastic event,energy conservation; energy efficiency; experimental study; machinery; manufacturing; simulation; software; statistical analysis; stochasticity; sustainable development; technological development,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71571075",Author Contributions: The authors contribute equally to this study.

This paper proposes to illustrate optional solutions to allow existing buildings to achieve NZEB goals. The aim of this study is to investigate factors that can improve existing building performance to be in line with the NZEB concept and be more sustainable. An existing townhouse inWashington, DC was chosen as the research target to study how to retrofit or reconstruct the design of a building according to the NZEB concept. The methodology of this research is modeling an existing townhouse to assess the current situation and creating optional models for improving energy efficiency of the townhouse in Revit and utilising renewable energy technology for energy supply. This residential building was modeled in three versions to compare changes in energy performance including improving thermal efficiency of building envelope, increasing thickness of the wall, and installing smart windows (switchable windows). These solutions can reduce energy and cost by approximately 8.16%, 10.16%, and 14.65%, respectively, compared to the original townhouse. Two renewable energy technologies that were considered in this research were photovoltaic and wind systems. The methods can be applied to reconstruct other existing buildings in the future. © 2019 by the authors.",BIM; Digital twin; Existing building; Net Zero Energy Building; Sustainability,alternative energy; building; design; energy efficiency; global warming; photovoltaic system; Washington,,,,,"691135; European Commission, EC; University of Birmingham; Australian Academy of Science; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: JSPS-L15701; University of Tokyo; African Academy of Sciences, AAS","This research was funded by the European Commission for the financial sponsorship of the H2020-MSCA-RISE Project No. 691135 ""RISEN: Rail Infrastructure Systems Engineering Network"", which enables a global research network that tackles the grand challenge in railway infrastructure resilience and advanced sensing.

Nowadays technologies reveal a new field for optimization of building control processes. This paper proposes an approach to automatize the heat supply management in a smart building. The goal is to reduce financial costs while keeping thermal comfort is in sustainable state. The authors review solutions of the heat supply process automation based on Internet of Things platforms. The proposed approach uses the possibility of gathering detailed information from temperature sensors. The data analysis allows observing changes and producing adequate heat management solutions in real time. In addition, the authors implemented methods for the classification of rooms from the temperature mode characteristic. The proposed approach forms the basis of an intellectual data analysis system, which is capable of a temperature mode modelling and controlling the heat supply process of the building. The system consists of three layers with unified data stream. The first layer handles raw data and performs preliminary processing. Moreover, it produces heat map of the building besides of modification of the data flow for the next module. The second layer is responsible for building classification models. Its main outputs are labeled as a frame building model based on derived classes. The third layer performs high-end analysis and builds digital twin of the building. The system provides both simulations of various temperature modes based on the generated temperature data and computational experiments with real data provided by special sensors. Temperature and weather (temperature, pressure, wind parameters) data are periodically requested from sensors located inside and, accordingly, outside the building. So, our system provides to apply streaming data from sensors for the periodical fitting of classification models, which improves their accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.",building thermal model; energy efficiency; Internet of Things; smart building; temperature mode,Automation; Buildings; Data handling; Energy utilization; Information analysis; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Process control; Building controls; Building Thermal models; Classification models; Computational experiment; Heat supply systems; Intellectual data analysis; Preliminary processing; Temperature modes; Energy efficiency,,,,,,,,"Park, J.Y., Nagy, Z., Comprehensive analysis of the relationship between thermal comfort and building control research -A data-driven literature review (2018) Renew.

As a technical implementation of the IoT controller, a measuring and control module based on a data acquisition, data transfer and control device-VIDA350, connected to the Telegraf data collection agent of the platform using the MQTT protocol, is proposed. The basic methods of processing raw data from energy meters and sensors of technological parameters, implemented in blocks of on-line and off-line calculations are given. The organization of the digital twin of the compressor using the database of time series InfluxDB and the relational database MSSQL, storing information about changes in the technological parameters of equipment over time, energy efficiency indicators, statistics on accidents and operating time, equipment models, etc., is proposed.

Thus, their efficiency depends on both component design and control strategy. Aiming for high efficiencies over the whole lifecycle, we apply Product Lifecycle Management and Digital Twin Design to HVAC systems, initially using an energy recovery ventilation (ERV) simulation model. We develop a Digital Twin Prototype in Modelica of the ERV unit to predict physical system behaviour. Verifying functionality and suitability, we set up a Digital Twin Instance (DTI) by calibrating the model against measurement data of the physical twin. DTI and physical twin communicate via MQTT interfaces with each other. The approach enables DTIs to calculate predictions for different scenarios per instance, which increases systems' efficiency significantly. In conclusion, this framework allows an application of innovative and predictive control and maintenance strategies to HVAC systems. © 2019 by International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) All rights reserved.",,Buildings; Climate control; Digital twin; Energy efficiency; HVAC; Life cycle; Product design; Stochastic systems; Tensors; Building energy systems; Energy recovery ventilations; Environmental interactions; Maintenance strategies; Nonlinear behaviours; Operational efficiencies; Predictive control; Product life cycle management; Structural design,,,,,,,,"Afram, A., Janabi-Sharifi, F., Theory and applications of HVAC control systems - A review of model predictive control (MPC) (2014) Building and Environment, 72, pp. 343-355; Dongellini, M., Sizing effects on the energy performance of reversible air-source heat pumps for office buildings (2017) Applied Thermal Engineering, pp. 1073-1081; Poppi, S., Influence of boundary conditions and component size on electricity demand in solar thermal and heat pump combisystems (2016) Applied Energy, 762, pp. 1062-1073; Stark, J., (2015) Product Lifecycle Management, , Cham: Springer International Publishing, (Decision Engineering); Staffel, I., A review of domestic heat pumps (2012) Energy Environ.

In December 2017, a prototype equipped with sensors able to log surface and layer temperature (on the inside and outside surface and within the construction layers), relative humidity as well as vertical global irradiation was mounted to the existing brickwork wall. The measurement interval was set to one minute. Two different control strategies for a minimal invasive radiant heating systems are compared in regard to energy efficiency and the deviation of the room temperature from a defined set point by thermal simulation. The validation is executed through alignments of simulation results and measured data by implementing measured boundary conditions. Results concerning the minimal inlet flow temperature, the control strategy and the thermal behavior can be multiplied and utilized for the refurbishment process of the whole building. © 2019 Building Simulation Conference Proceedings.

In this study, we introduce an open micro energy grid platform to operate the widely distributed microgrids in Korea. Subsequently, we present commercial microgrid business models supported by the open micro energy grid platform equipped with an artificial intelligence engine and provide test results from testbeds connected to the platform. In contrast to the existing microgrid business models in the market, we propose a universal architecture and business model of the future microgrid, comprising (i) an energy robot-management operation business model, (ii) electric vehicle-based demand response, (iii) blockchain technology for energy trading, and (iv) a service-oriented business model. Finally, we propose a new business model for an intelligent virtual power plant (VPP) operator along with the architecture of the VPP and its proof of concept (PoC). We expect the proposed business model to provide energy solution providers with guidelines to develop various VPP services. © 2019 by the authors.

According to forecasts of experts given in the study 'Distributed energy in Russia: potential for development', the architecture of a distributed energy (DE) system being created will include the following elements: manageable interfaces, 'routers of energy', and platforms of management and services. Most of the platform solutions being created include only a part of the elements from the list above. Existing solutions in the field of DE are based on algorithms that do not provide the flexibility of decision-making and the proper level of security. The purpose of our work is to develop the concept of the intelligent management system of DE facilities. The principle of modular programming using the kernel expansion method was taken as a basis for the development of the concept. The proposed intelligent management system operates in real-Time and allows implementing new algorithms and methods of control of the power system, including the management of its active elements. The subsequent development of the project includes the development of the architecture of the software platform and the implementation of the management system of DE facilities. Using the results of the work will increase the efficiency of management of DE facilities. © 2019 IEEE.",demand response; distributed energy; distributed generation; management system; optimum route,Computer architecture; Decision making; Distributed power generation; Energy conservation; Facilities; Demand response; Distributed energies; Intelligent management systems; Kernel expansion; Management systems; Modular programming; Optimum route; Software platforms; Energy management systems,,,,,,,,"Khokhlov, A., Melnikov, Yu., Veselov, F., Holkin, D., Datsko, K., Distributed energy in Russia: Potential assessment, "" (In Russian), Moscow, P, 87, p. 2018; Bulatov, B.G., Tarasenko, V.V., Algorythms of intelligent control of distributing network mode, "" (In Russian (2012) Bulletin of South Ural State University.

In these procedures, the decision-making to select and fix a future scenario and its time limit are important factors. In this study, considering the scenario decision time limit, a procrastination strategy is introduced and formulated as a new model predictive control framework. It is to postpone the decision and preserve the freedom of scenario choice for the future. In the proposed method, the concept of a common admissible set for control trajectory and its branch point are introduced. A simple numerical example and an application to an energy management problem are shown to illustrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 The Society of Instrument and Control Engineers - SICE.",,Decision making; Embedded systems; Numerical methods; Admissible set; Control strategies; Control trajectory; Management problems; Objective functions; Optimal strategies; Physical world; Scenario-based modeling; Model predictive control,,,,,JPMJMI17B5,"This work was supported by JST-Mirai Program Grant Number JPMJMI17B5, Japan.",,"Society5.0 Cabinet Office of Japan Home Page (In Japanese), , https://www8.cao.go.jp/cstp/society5_0/index.html, Cabinet Office of Japan; Cyber physical systems executive summary (2008) The CPS Steering Group, , http://iccps2012.cse.wustl.edu/_doc/CPS-Executive-Summary.pdf, March 6; Masudul Alam, K., El Saddik, A., C2PS: A digital twin archtecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 2050-2062. , Digital Objective ID; Maciejowski, J.M., Predictive control with constraints (2002) Pearson Education Limited; Calafiore, G.C., Fagiano, L., Robust model predictive control via scenario optimization (2013) IEEE Trans.

In 1969, the rural population accounted for about 70 percent of the global population. By 2069, urban population will account for more than the same percentage. With half of the world's population already living in cities, we are in the midst of the most significant demographic shift in modern history. The rising density of urban areas requires the development of more mid-To-high-rise buildings, which allow for the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective usage of space. Tall buildings are becoming more like vertical cities, providing office, residential and commercial space. Just like any other place in a city, every location within a building needs to be well connected if it is to attract commercial investors, tenants, and shoppers. To achieve this level of connectivity, buildings need future, flexible transport systems, similar to a metro. © 2019 50 Forward | 50 Back: The Recent History and Essential Future of Sustainable Cities - Proceedings of the CTBUH 10th World Congress.

We aim to minimize the normalized energy consumption, defined as the energy consumption per bit, by optimizing user association, resource allocation, and offloading probabilities subject to the quality-of-service requirements. The user association is managed by the mobility management entity (MME), while resource allocation and offloading probabilities are determined by each access point (AP). We propose a deep learning (DL) architecture, where a digital twin of the real network environment is used to train the DL algorithm off-line at a central server. From the pre-trained deep neural network (DNN), the MME can obtain user association scheme in a real-time manner. Considering that the real networks are not static, the digital twin monitors the variation of real networks and updates the DNN accordingly. For a given user association scheme, we propose an optimization algorithm to find the optimal resource allocation and offloading probabilities at each AP. The simulation results show that our method can achieve lower normalized energy consumption with less computation complexity compared with an existing method and approach to the performance of the global optimal solution. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",deep learning (DL); digital twin; mobile edge computing (MEC); resource allocation; Ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC); user association,Deep neural networks; E-learning; Edge computing; Energy utilization; Probability; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Computation complexity; digital twin; Global optimal solutions; Low-latency communication; mobile edge computing (MEC); Optimal resource allocation; Optimization algorithms; User associations; 5G mobile communication systems,,,,,"FL160100032; Australian Research Council, ARC: DE150101704, DP150104019, DP190101988","Manuscript received January 16, 2019; revised May 7, 2019 and July 1, 2019; accepted July 2, 2019.

Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and prognostics of machines and products. Traditionally, building a digital twin requires many built-in sensors to monitor various physical phenomena associated with cyber-physical systems such as vibration, energy consumption, etc. However, many legacy manufacturing systems do not have multi-physics sensors built-in by default. Moreover, it might not be feasible to intrusively place sensors in these systems after they are manufactured. To bring the advantages of digitalization to legacy manufacturing systems, this paper contributes with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based methodology to build digital twins using an indirect medium such as side-channels, which can localize anomalous faults and infer the quality of the products being manufactured while keeping itself up-to-date. We achieve this by exploring and utilizing the side-channels (emissions such as acoustics, power, magnetic, etc.) of the system that unintentionally reveal the cyber and physical state of the system. To validate our methodology, in this paper, we focus on building a digital twin model of a Fused-Deposition Modeling (FDM) based Cartesian additive manufacturing system. The proposed methodology achieves 83.09% accuracy in anomaly localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the possibility of modeling and maintaining a living digital twin of a manufacturing system by extracting information from the side-channels using low-end IoT sensors. © 2019 ACM.",digital twin; internet-of-things; machine learning; smart manufacturing,3D printers; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Fused Deposition Modeling; Learning systems; Legacy systems; Product design; Structural design; Anomaly localizations; Built-in sensors; digital twin; Extracting information; Internet of Things (IOT); Physical phenomena; Physical systems; Smart manufacturing; Internet of things,,,,,CNS-1546993,This work was partially supported by NSF CPS grant CNS-1546993.,,"Negri, E., Fumagalli, L., A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems (2017) Procedia Manufacturing; Grieves, M., Vickers, J., Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems (2017) Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Complex Systems, , Springer; (2017) Industry 4. 0 and the Digital Twin: Manufacturing Meets Its Match.

Precise usage of cutting tools is believed to improve economic, environmental and social benefits greatly. However, the problem that the physical cutting tool was difficult to be reacted by modelling and simulation of its degradation process made the cutting tool usage, replacement and sharpening lack of reliable support, which affected optimization and control for precise usage of cutting tools and dynamic adjustment of machining system. Based on the concept of digital twin, a digital twin model for cutting tools in machining process was proposed, and its concept, structure, function and running procedure were investigated in detail. Digital twin-driven cutting tool wear condition monitoring, remaining useful life prediction, cutting tool selection decision-making and cutting service were also addressed deeply. A prototype was developed to illustrate and validate the model. Through interaction and fusion of physical cutting tools and virtual models, the digital twin model for cutting tools in machining process enabled an intelligent, proactive and predictive cutting tool management mode to support optimization, decision-making and service. © 2019, Editorial Department of CIMS.

Given the current battery and charging technology, driving experience of EVs relies heavily on the availability and reachability of EV charging infrastructure. As the number of charging piles increases, carefully designed arrangement of resources and efficient utilization of the infrastructure is essential to the future development of EV industry. The mobility and distribution of EVs determine the charging demand and the load of power distribution grid. Then, dynamic traffic pattern of numerous interconnected EVs poses great impact on charging plans and charging infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce the digital twin of a real-world EV by modeling the mobility based on a time series behaviors of EVs to evaluate the charging algorithm and pile arrangement policy. The introduced digital twin EV is a virtually simulated equivalence with same traffic behaviors and charging activities as the EV in real world. The behavior and route choice of EVs is dynamically simulated base on the time-varying driving operations, travel intent, and charging plan in a simulated large-scale charging scenario composed of concurrently moving EVs and correspondingly equipped charging piles. Different EV navigation algorithms and charging algorithms of Internet of Vehicle can be exactly evaluated in the dynamic simulation of the digital twins of the moving EVs and charging infrastructure. Then we analyze the collected data such as energy consumption, charging capacity, charging frequency, and waiting time in queue on both the EV side and the charging pile side to evaluate the charging efficiency. The simulation is used to study the relations between the scheduled charging operation of EVs and the deployment of piles. The proposed model helps evaluate and validate the design of the charging recommendation and the deployment plan regarding to the arrangement and distribution of charging piles. © 2019, The Author(s).",Charging scheduling; Digital twin; Electric vehicle; Internet of Vehicles; Mobility; Time series,Carrier mobility; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Piles; Time series; Charging efficiency; Charging infrastructures; Digital twin; Dynamic traffic patterns; Ev charging infrastructures; Low-carbon emissions; Navigation algorithms; Power distribution grids; Charging (batteries),,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61572153, 61572492, 61672020, 61871140, U1636215; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation: 4172006; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2018YFB0803504; Guangdong Province Higher Vocational Colleges and Schools Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province: 2019B010137004","This work is supported in part by the Guangdong Province Key Research and Development Plan (No. 2019B010137004), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1636215, 61871140, 61572153, 61572492, 61672020), the National Key research and Development Plan (Grant No. 2018YFB0803504),?the Beijing Municipal Natural Science Fundation (No. 4172006), and the Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme (2019).","This work is supported in part by the Guangdong Province Key Research and Development Plan (No. 2019B010137004), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1636215, 61871140, 61572153, 61572492, 61672020), the National Key research and Development Plan (Grant No. 2018YFB0803504), the Beijing Municipal Natural Science Fundation (No. 4172006), and the Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme (2019).","Lopes, J., Soares, F., Almeida, P., Integration of electric vehicles in the electric power system (2011) Proc IEEE, pp. 168-183; Tian, Z., Su, S., Shi, W., Du, X., Guizani, M., Yu, X., A data-driven model for future Internet route decision modeling (2019) Future Generation Comput Syst, 95, pp. 212-220; Tirez, A., Luickx, P., He, X., Rious, V., (2010) Optimal Charging Schedule of an Electric Vehicle Fleet, 7Th International Conference on the European Energy Market (EEM), 23-25, pp. 1-6. , June; Lee, J., Kim, H.-J., Park, G.-L., Jeon, H., Genetic Algorithm-Based Charging Task Scheduler for Electric Vehicles in Smart Transportation (2012) Intelligent Information and Database Systems, pp. 208-217. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Berlin, Heidelberg; Clement, K., Haesen, E., Driesen, J., The impact of charging plug-in hybrid electric vehicles on the distribution grid[J] (2010) IEEE Transact Power Systems, 25 (1), pp. 371-380; Babaei, S., Steen, D., Le, T.A., Carlson, O., Bertling, L., (2010) Effects of plug-in electric vehicles on distribution systems: A real case of Gothenburg, pp. 11-13. , Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe (ISGT Europe), IEEE, Oct; Sanchez, M., Manzoni, P., A java-based ad hoc networks simulator (1999) Proc. of the SCS Western Multiconference Web-Based Simulation Track, , Jan; Wang, Z.-P., Sun, F.-C., (2006) Computing Method of Energy Consumption in EV Typical Driving Mode, 26, pp. 69-72; Toepfer, C., (2009) SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler, , SAE J1772.

More in details, these analyses are related to the variability of production quality, prediction of the maintenance cycle, the accurate estimation of energy consumption and other extra-functional properties of the system. This is the core of what is so called Industry 4.0. Every single node of the manufacturing process needs to be modelled as a Cyber-physical system to be able to make the mentioned analyses. However, Manufacturing simulators represent these systems with a high level of abstraction, making impossible precise analyses. In the state of the art, some solutions try to solve the problem connecting multiple domain-specific simulators, to preserve details but requiring complex co-simulation environments. This paper presents a methodology for the integration of Cyber-Physical Systems in production line simulators, avoiding these issues. The proposed solution is based on a new promising technology: the Function Mockup Interface (FMI). This standard defines an interface to exports models as blocks called Functional Mockup Units (FMUs). These FMUs can be easily integrated together composing heterogeneous systems. The methodology is composed of two steps: 1) Exporting Digital and Physical systems as different FMUs 2) Integration of the FMUs into a production line simulator. An example is used to validate our solution which clearly shows the limitations of the production line simulator without the integration of CPSs. This paper aims at producing Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) to make more accurate simulations, and hence more accurate analysis of the production line. © 2018 IEEE.",,Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Manufacture; Mockups; Simulators; VLSI circuits; Accurate estimation; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Extra-functional properties; Heterogeneous systems; High level of abstraction; Maintenance cycles; Manufacturing process; Production quality; Cyber Physical System,,,,,,,,"Drath, R., Horch, A., Industrie 4.0: Hit or hype?

Considering global ambitions to reduce carbon emissions and minimise the rate and impacts of climate change, this demand will need to be met with energy from low carbon sources. Increased electrification of heat and transport networks is anticipated, however, the crosssectoral impacts of different interventions in these systems must be better understood to prevent gains in one system leading to losses in another while ensuring financial benefits for producers and consumers. As such, evaluating the impacts of specific interventions can be a challenge, with analyses typically focussed on individual systems. In this paper, a simulation environment is developed to capture the behaviour of interconnected heat, power and transport networks in an urban environment to act as a 'digital twin' for the energy systems of a district or city. The modelling environment illustrated here is based on the smart city interventions in Greenwich (London), with model validation carried out using real data measurements. Building retrofit and heat electrification interventions are demonstrated in terms of costs, energy consumption and C02 emissions, considering constraints on power and thermal systems. © International Conference on Smart Infrastructure and Construction 2019, ICSIC 2019: Driving Data-Informed Decision-Making.",,Carbon; Climate change; Decision making; Digital twin; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Smart city; Urban growth; Building retrofits; Financial benefits; Individual systems; Modelling environment; Simulation environment; Technological change; Transport networks; Urban environments; Urban transportation,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 691895; Greater London Authority, GLA; Siemens","This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 691895.

In order to keep reliable electricity costs low for consumers and demand charges low for utilities, there exist markets and financial incentives for limiting consumption during peak demand. The team has partnered with an electrical distributor servicing a 1,390 km2 area and 178,368 buildings with the aim of using urban-scale building energy modelling to inform business decisions necessary for the operation of their electric grid. A suite of software has been developed that allows the scalable creation of a ""digital twin"" for all buildings in the utility's service area. This virtual utility area is analysed for targeted deployment of new technologies or policies to assess building-specific savings, effects on critically-loaded grid infrastructure (e.g. feeders, substations), and aggregated impact to utility-scale operations. This work leverages 15-minute data from each building to compare actual and simulated monthly peak-hour demand and assessment of the load factor for each building. Findings include market characterization via clustering of relative energy use profiles for~180,000 buildings as well as simulation-informed savings opportunities indicating residential load factors of 0.17, commercial load factors of 0.2-0.4 depending on year of construction, and general load factors of 0.16-0.5 depending on building type. © 2019 Building Simulation Conference Proceedings.

These rotatory hydraulic machines have a strong impact on the energy consumption of industry worldwide, not only because of their vast amount but also because of their continuous operation. Therefore, developing techniques to improve the efficiency of pumping systems is of great help to make communities and industrial activity more sustainable. The overall performance of these pieces of machinery cannot be fully predicted by means of analytical procedures due to the complexity of the fluid flow phenomena that occurs in their interior, so it is common practice to resort to alternate modeling techniques, such as computer aided numerical analysis, which can predict the performance of a pump, given its CAD computer model. However, the performance of an actual centrifugal pump may deviate from its ideal behavior due to multiple causing factors which may alter the performance curves given by the manufacturers in the corresponding data sheets. The discrepancies between the real and the simulated responses of centrifugal pumps demand for better modeling and simulation techniques to improve the design of more efficient pumping systems. Digital twins have the ability to bring the simulation environment closer to reality, by replicating the behavior of the physical system in a simulation environment with the support of experimental data. The digital twin of a multiple pumps system with serial and parallel configurations was developed, based on two identical industrial centrifugal pumps available in the laboratory. Experimental data was collected to calibrate the digital twin system so that the simulated system can predict the response under changing operating conditions. The simulation environment was developed with the assistance of a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics computer program. After validating the behavior of the virtual components, with respect to the behavior of their actual counterparts, tests were carried out to predict the behavior of the pumping system in case of downstream disturbances which can affect the operating point of the overall pumping system and its corresponding efficiency. The development of the digital twin for the pumping system allowed visualizing how the pumps connected in series or in parallel can be maneuvered to adjust its operating conditions to achieve higher efficiency operating conditions in response to changes in the conditions downstream in the pipeline.

Within a highway ecosystem, for example, autonomous vehicles could deploy smart agents in the form of software applications. This would enable cooperative driving and ultimately formation of vehicle platoons that reduce air friction and fuel consumption. In the smart grid domain, software-defined virtual power plants could be established to enable remote and autonomous collaboration of various units, such as smart meters, data concentrators, and distributed energy resources, in order to optimize power generation, demand-side energy and power storage. Effective collaboration within these emerging digital ecosystems strongly relies on the assumption that all components of the ecosystem operate as expected, and a level of trust among them is established based on that. In this paper, we present the idea of trust-based digital ecosystems, built upon the concept of a digital twin of this ecosystem, as a machine readable representation of the system and a representation of goals and trust at runtime. This creates demand for introducing a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems that would capture their main concepts and relationships. By modeling the goals of the actors and systems, a reference architecture can provide a basis for analyzing competitive forces that influence the health of an ecosystem. © 2019 ACM.",Automotive smart ecosystem; Collaborative embedded systems; Digital ecosystems; Reference architecture; Smart ecosystems; Smart grid; Software ecosystems,Application programs; Digital storage; Digital twin; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Energy resources; Power plants; Smart power grids; Software agents; Software architecture; Autonomous computing; Digital ecosystem; Distributed Energy Resources; Reference architecture; Smart grid; Software applications; Software ecosystems; Virtual power plants; Ecosystems,,,,,"Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF: CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000822","This work has been funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the BMBF project CrESt (Collaborative Embedded Systems), and by ERDF ""CyberSecurity, CyberCrime and Critical Information Infrastructures Center of Excellence"" (No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000822).","This work has been funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the BMBF project CrESt (Collaborative Embedded Systems), and by ERDF ""CyberSecurity, CyberCrime and Critical Information Infrastructures Center of Excellence"" (No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16-019/0000822).","Amorim, T., Ruiz, A., Dropmann, C., Schneider, D., Multidirectional modular conditional safety certificates (2014) International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security, pp. 357-368. , Springer; Avgeriou, P., Describing, instantiating and evaluating a reference architecture: A case study (2003) Enterprise Architecture Journal; Avizienis, A., Laprie, J.-C., Randell, B., Landwehr, C., Basic concepts and taxonomy of dependable and secure computing (2004) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 1 (1), pp. 11-33. , 2004; Baars, A., Jansen, S., A framework for software ecosystem governance (2012) International Conference of Software Business, pp. 168-180. , Springer; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 13th International Software Product Line Conference, pp. 111-119. , Carnegie Mellon University; Cioroaica, E., Kuhn, T., Bauer, T., Prototyping automotive smart ecosystems (2018) 2018 48th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN-W).

Most of them are technological approaches, e.g. by changing engine control parameters, usage of different fuels, exhaust gas-treatment systems or internal measures to make the engine itself more efficient or eco-friendly. The lost part in this measures is, that there are still humans who are in charge of controlling the vessel and that they should be kept in the loop of efficiency. For numerous vessels, it is neither efficient nor economically reasonable to exchange or enhance the existing power generation or propulsion systems in order to improve efficiency or reduce emissions. Some internal measures even lead to a higher fuel consumption in order to reduce NOx-emissions. Therefore optimal operational procedures for handling ships and specifically the outcome of engine manoeuvres is a substantial source for eco-friendly ship operations. The German research project MEmBran (Modelling Emissions and Fuel Consumption during Ship Manoeuvres) addresses especially the basis for optimising ship engine manoeuvres. It focusses on a very detailed simulation of the processes of currently existing ship diesel engines (in a first step 4-stroke engines) in order to apply them within a more comprehensive ship handling simulation software. As a part of an existing planning and prediction software that can be used on board, it enables the watchkeeping nautical officer and the shipping company to forecast and compare the fuel consumption of the ship for each manoeuvre. It further allows to identify the best option of the ship operator's possible actions under several conditions and afterwards a comparison of varying manoeuvre strategies of different navigators will be enabled. © 2019 IEEE.",Assistance Systems; Automation; Digital Twin - Manoeuvring; Electronic Support - Controls; Measurement Monitoring,Computer software; Efficiency; Environmental protection; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuels; Oceanography; Ship propulsion; Engine control parameters; Exhaust gas treatment; Operational procedures; Propulsion system; Ship operation; Ship operators; Shipping companies; Support systems; Ships,,,,,Universität Rostock,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT The above described approach derived from a German research project, granted by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy.

This paper considers this in the engineering world of power generation, gas turbines & power plant-and asks the question: What will it take to make a Digital Twin real. A Digital Twin must have physics-based simulation at its heart and confront three major challenges: Scale of simulation; Scaling the simulation; Responding to data-driven feedback. This paper will discuss these issues in turn and make the case that the ability to represent & manage geometry is the Digital Thread which supports a Digital Twin. We discuss the use of classical BREP CAD and the new Digital Geometry solid modelling kernel we have been developing.

The off-design in small and mid-sized power generation and pumping gas turbine units is caused by the present grid demands, different ambient conditions, etc. In turn, aircraft and marine propulsion GTEs off-design are caused by variations in operation regime. Off-design/part load conditions influence not only the gas turbine efficiency but also its reliable operation, in particular, the hot gas path parts and compressor’s margin to surge. The development of a flexible, fast and high fidelity approach of GTU part-load and off-design performance prediction is of vital importance with the capability to analyze all the parameters of a compressor, turbine and cooling system. The objective of the presented study is to elaborate on such an approach. In this paper, the concept of digital twin to predict off-design GTU performance is utilized. Digital twin, or a specially organized collection of physics-based methods/modules, was created for the power generation unit-166MW GTU prototype. The GTU including its design, the overall scheme, and cooling system are described in details. The methods which comprise the digital twin are presented, including calculation methods and loss models with an indication of prediction accuracy. The flowchart of the process of off-design performance estimation and data transfer between the modules are given as well. The validation of the GTU digital twin, comparing the predicted power correction factor with the respective test data obtained for a variety of ambient temperature magnitudes is described. The comparison of the results obtained utilizing GTU digital twin with other approaches is provided. The GTU part-load performance estimation results sensitivity to an application of 0D and 1D cooling system simulation approaches in the digital twin is studied. GTU part-load performance prediction results obtained utilizing the developed digital twin are described and discussed in details. Some aspects of application of this approach to aircraft engine are considered as well. Conclusions are given for the developed digital twin for accuracy, applicability, and peculiarities. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Model is the foundation and core of digital twin theories and technologies, but the traditional three-dimension digital twin model can no longer meet the new application requirements and technology development trends. To promote the application of digital twin in more fields, a five-dimension digital twin model was put forward in authors' previous research to digital twin shop-floor. In view of the new demands on digital twin and based on the previous research, a more systematic five-dimension digital twin model was presented. Furthermore, its applications in ten fields were discussed, including satellite/space communication network, ships, vehicles, power plant, aircraft, complex equipment, stereoscopic warehouse, medical, shop-floor and smart city, which could provide theoretical and methodological references for the application of digital twin in the future. © 2019, Editorial Department of CIMS.

The Semantic Web, linked data, knowledge graphs and web services/agents are key technologies for implementing the above concepts. In this paper, we present a comprehensive semantic agent composition framework. It enables automatic agent discovery and composition to generate cross-domain applications. This framework is based on a light-weight agent ontology, OntoAgent, which is an adaptation of the Minimal Service Model (MSM) ontology. The MSM ontology was extended with grounding components to support the execution of an agent while keeping the compatibility with other existing web service description standards and extensibility. We illustrate how the comprehensive agent composition framework can be integrated into the J-Park Simulator (JPS) knowledge graph, for the automatic creation of a composite agent that simulates the dispersion of the emissions of a power plant within a selected spatial area. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Agent; Cross-domain; Knowledge graph; Linked data; Semantic web; Semantic web service composition,Agents; Data handling; Linked data; Ontology; Semantic Web; Websites; Agent ontologies; Automatic creations; Composition frameworks; Cross-domain; Knowledge graphs; Process industries; Semantic web service compositions; Web service description; Web services,,,,,"Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; National Research Foundation, NRF; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","This project is supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme.

This paper presents a case study of PPSM on a 320-MWe coal-fired thermal power-plant unit, demonstrating how the digital-Twin technology was employed to explore and analyse optimization solutions. Various optimization solutions and their cost-effectiveness were assessed using the digital-Twin-modelling analysis; the results indicated the optimization solutions are expected to improve the plant unit's operating efficiency and reduce its current electricity-generation coal consumption by up to 3.5 g/kWh standard coal equivalent (sce), worth annual fuel-cost savings of approximately 4 million RMB for a single unit or 8 million RMB for the two identical 320-MWe units that the power plant currently operates. The digital twin was also employed to assess the power-plant unit's operating economics during both summer and winter. In summer, when the unit operates in electricity-generation-only mode, the unit's operating thermal efficiency could drop by up to 6% points following the grid demand of load changes from 100% maximum continuous rating (MCR) down to 30%MCR, resulting in an ~ 45 RMB/MWh increase of electricity-generation cost. In winter, when the unit operates in combined heat and power (CHP) cogeneration mode, for the same boiler load, the CHP operation increases the plant unit's operating profit with increasing district-heating duty, although the relative profit gain from the CHP cogeneration could start to decrease when the district-heating steam-extraction flow increases to a certain point that varies depending on the market prices of heat and electricity, while the fuel cost was found to be equivalent to ~50% of the unit's total CHP income cogenerated from its electricity and district heat outputs. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

According to the Industry 4.0 concepts, similarly to the intelligent manufacturing for new factories, the use of digital twins for power plants is expected to progress. Researchers do the safety and cybersecurity analysis from various perspectives utilize different approaches, e.g. on the safety side, the FMEA (Failure Mode & Effect Analysis), FMECA (Failure mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis) are recommended by FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) to do the reliability analysis. On the cybersecurity part, researchers do the analysis only with a focus on the communication protocol, the code/memory level or on the system functionality. We have addressed refueling machines as an example for the joint consideration of functional safety and cybersecurity in previous publications. Whereas in this paper, we propose to do a functionality and cybersecurity analysis based on the digital twin of an ICS (Industrial Control System). We take the refueling machine as an example and discuss how to twin the refueling machine with high detail firstly. In addition, the possible way of how to model the ICS is discussed, e.g. the Automation ML will be used to describe the system, the OPC UA will be applied to implement the communication. Then the feasibility and benefit of analyzing the system functionality and cybersecurity based on the digital twin model are discussed. © 2019 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

Digital twins have been used extensively to detect anomalies, prevent failures and encourage preventive maintenance activities. An active area of research is how to shift from preventative maintenance based on current conditions, to predictive maintenance based on future conditions. Close mapping of historical engine performance against air quality metrics and ambient weather conditions allow significant progress to be made towards true predictive maintenance, by providing a greater understanding of the condition of the turbine air inlet and compressor section. This allows for increasingly accurate predictions of future engine degradation due to air inlet pressure drop and compressor degradation to a fidelity useful for scheduling maintenance needs. An economic optimization can then be performed balancing the costs of the two engine degradation modes and the corrective actions that can be taken, namely air inlet pressure drop against filter replacement interval, and compressor degradation against compressor soak wash interval.

The problems arising in the course of their operation are noted. It is proposed to solve these problems to reconsider the HPP structure so that they can be operated in a stand-alone unattended mode, using simple and reliable basic energy conversion elements. The authors suggest using a centrifugal pump as a turbine, without regulating the rotational speed. The absence of a turbine speed regulator containing movable mechanical devices for regulating the flow of water to the turbine will significantly increase its reliability and simplify state diagnostics operations. As a generator, it is suggested using an unregulated synchronous machine with excitation from permanent magnets. The application of a generator consisting of two structurally complete units, a rotor with permanent magnets and a stator with a winding will also increase its reliability, significantly increase the time of interregional checks, simplifying them. The required output voltage quality and high reliability must be provided with a semiconductor converter. In order to diagnose the state of a power plant, it is proposed, in addition to sensors for mechanical, thermal and electrical values, to include in its composition a complete mathematical model, that is, its digital twin and diagnostics to be carried out, including on the basis of comparison of measured actual and received values from a digital twin. The article also shows the problems arising in the implementation of the proposed structure, and ways to solve them. © 2019 IEEE.",Centrifugal pump; Permanent magnet synchronous machine; Remote control; Self-diagnosis; Semiconductor voltage converter; Small HPP; Stand-alone mode; Voltage balancing,Centrifugal pumps; Electric power systems; Energy conversion; Hydroelectric generators; Permanent magnets; Reliability; Remote control; Rotors (windings); Synchronous machinery; Permanent magnet synchronous machines; Self diagnosis; Small HPP; Stand-alone modes; Voltage balancing; Voltage converter; Balancing,,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: № 14-19-00327",ACKNOWLEDGMENT The work was carried out at the SUSU with the financial support of the Russian Science Foundation (project № 14-19-00327).

Nevertheless, simulators are usually tailor-made for a specific application. This paper proposes an original approach, an architecture for a software tool capable of simulating any electric power system application, the first energy-oriented meta-simulator. This tool would only require the definition of a set of behavior rules, easing the process of developing new simulators aimed at the energy sector. Its applications range from pure software simulators, that could be used with, for example, benchmarking, decision-making or competition purposes, to applications monitoring and controlling energy assets in real-time, such as hardware devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, or power plants) or digital twins. The proposed architecture resulted by studying previous tools and simulators with the objective of finding common blocks and elements to abstract them. For this reason, the proposed architecture intents to encompass any tool that aims to model the energy sector. Additionally, the proposed architecture is compliant with lightweight Internet of Things (IoT) protocols and smart systems and supports the synchronization with other frameworks at different levels. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity market; Energy platforms; Internet of Things; Meta-simulator; Software architecture,Application programs; Decision making; Digital devices; Electric power systems; Internet of things; Network architecture; Power markets; Simulators; Software architecture; Benchmarking tools; Electrical applications; Energy platforms; Internet of Things (IOT); Monitoring and controlling; Proposed architectures; Regulatory model; Software simulator; Benchmarking,,,,,,,,"Martín-Martínez, F., Sánchez-Miralles, A., Rivier, M., Prosumers’ optimal DER investments and DR usage for thermal and electrical loads in isolated microgrids (2016) Electr.

The most critical process is performed in the hot cell, where the casks of spent fuel are unloaded and encapsulated into canisters. To validate the control system design and the operation of the equipment used in the unloading process, Tecnatom has developed an engineering simulator. The simulator has both the Human Machine Interface (HMI) for the remote operation of the equipment replicating the one of the control systems, as well as a virtual reality environment of the hot cell. A series of functionalities have been introduced to analyze the operation an detect aspects to be improved in the design. Thanks to this, the HMI has been properly redesigned, potential issues of the control system has been early detected, and a better understanding of the system achieved. In addition, the virtual reality environment of the hot cell helps decision-making for other aspects of the design, such as the location of video cameras. Finally, the simulator can be used in the future as a training platform and be the basis of a digital twin of the facility. © 2018 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC All Rights Reserved",Design Validation; Simulation; Virtual Reality,Control systems; Decision making; Fuel storage; Man machine systems; Nuclear power plants; Radioactive waste encapsulation; Radioactive waste storage; Simulators; Spent fuels; Unloading; Video cameras; Design validation; Engineering simulator; Human Machine Interface; Interim storage facilities; Simulation; Training platform; Unloading process; Virtual-reality environment; Virtual reality,,,,,,"This project has been possible thanks to the collaboration of the ATC project team in Enresa, especially Mara L?pez as head of I&C and Human Factors.

However, the construction industry has a poor record for delivering productivity and efficiency advancement. As proven in other industries, digital methods can shorten product development time and cost by reducing prototyping with the use of numerical simulation. Further, a digital twin is an extensive computational model of a product that is planned to improve over its lifecycle by leveraging operational data. This paper presents a coupled simulation for the thermal design of a heating and cooling system that is integrated with a lightweight roof structure. The concrete roof structure is shape optimised to provide a low embodied energy building element, which is thermally activated to supply space conditioning from a renewable geothermal source. This work is focused on the modelling methodology used by the energy domain to support the development of a digital twin for a multifunctional building element. High-resolution analysis is used to resolve building physics issues and to provide the initial system performance. A parametric geometry model is used to apply the hydronic pipework to a complex roof shape. With input from the previous two steps, a reduced resolution method is used to add the characteristics of the system to an industry standard whole building simulation model. This final step allows for the development of initial control strategies for the novel multifunctional element. The implications of the research findings are discussed in the context of possible alternations to the building design process due to the influence of digital fabrication. © 2019",Building simulation; Digital fabrication; Digital twin; Early integrated design; Improved lifecycle energy; Thermally activated building system (TABS),Architectural design; Building components; Construction industry; Geothermal energy; Life cycle; Numerical methods; Roof coverings; Building simulation; Building systems; Digital fabrication; Digital twin; Improved lifecycle energy; Integrated designs; Structural design,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Kommission für Technologie und Innovation, CTI; EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule ZÃ¼rich, ETH; National Centre of Competence in Research Robotics","D.

One internal audit conducted by an oil and gas company found its upstream employees spent up to 80 percent of their time just looking for, then converting the data because the data historically has not been housed in one place within one platform. Traditionally, employees must collect large volumes of information from multiple data sources, including spreadsheets, data streams or tacit knowledge. Alone, the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors connected to equipment in the field can send 1,000 readings a minute to engineers, resulting in an insurmountable data for engineers to assess critically. All of this effort results in underutilized time and loss of money. The paper's topic addresses the digital twin technology solution which solves energy company's Big Data problems and recoups the wasted time and associated costs of field workers looking for data. Specifically, FutureOn's FieldTwin technology offers a cloud-based, comprehensive and secure platform with the ability to break up the barriers of the data silos built by legacy systems, creating accessible data across the company. Employees spend less time searching for data, and more time identifying trends and innovative ways to exploit the data, i.e., smarter drilling, greater field automation or improved safety. FieldTwin technology also provides a real-time, data-driven visual representation of the field that creates actionable data, whether it is an operator using the visualization of its subsea assets for field expansions or a renewable company utilizing the digitalization of its offshore wind projects for more effective planning. Studies show humans respond to and process visual data better than any other type of data. The human brain processing images 60,000 times faster than text, and 90 percent of information transmitted to the brain is visual. FieldTwin exploits this reality to enhance data processing and organizational effectiveness spanning project management to risk management in the field. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference",,Data visualization; Gas industry; Internet of things; Legacy systems; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Offshore technology; Personnel; Project management; Public utilities; Risk management; Wind power; Internet of thing (IOT); Multiple data sources; Offshore resources; Offshore wind projects; Oil and gas companies; Organizational effectiveness; Technology solutions; Visual representations; Data handling,,,,,,,,"(2016) THE 2016 OIL AND GAS DIGITAL TRENDS SURVEY, , https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/insight-2016-upstream-oil-gas-digital-trends-survey, Microsoft Retrieved from Accenture; (2017) Drill Deeper into Digital: Accenture and Microsoft 2017 Upstream Oil and Gas Digital Trends Survey, , https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/insight-2017-upstream-oil-gas-digital-trends-survey, Microsoft Retrieved from Accenture; Amery, N., (2018) Data: Is the Oil and Gas Industry's Most Valuable Resource Being Overlooked?, , https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/data-is-oil-gas-industry.html#_ftn1, February 21.

Especially within infrastructure systems of systems and the applications of the internet of things, data became an asset for additional tasks regarding their efficient and effective operations, e.g., predictive maintenance which lowers the total costs of ownership. Many of these tasks are well supported by digital twins but building such digital replicas of systems and processes within a system of system is complicated by that context, e.g., due to the managerial independence of the contributing systems that often restricts available information and data sharing.

Digital Twin technology, widely used in the aviation, manufacturing and automotive industries, has the potential to improve the security and resiliency of the microgrid. In this paper, we present a framework for adapting the Digital Twin to the application of microgrid security. The Digital Twin is a real-time, physics-based simulation that runs alongside the physical system providing for its constant monitoring and control. The Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems, or ANGEL, will model both the cyber and physical layers of the microgrid and provide real-time data visualization. As a result, users will be aided in assessing the health of the physical plant and overall behavior over a range of operating conditions. The ANGEL Digital Twin will be able to use the real-time two-way coupling between the simulation and physical system to update and evolve the simulation to provide greater insight into the physical system. Ultimately ANGEL will provide the ability to diagnose and heal the physical system, mitigating both component failures and the effects of cyber attack. This paper will explain the methodology behind the design of this digital twin and the advantages of such an approach.

The connections between humans, devices, and their digital twins are growing in numbers, creating a need for new kind of security and trust solutions. To address these needs, industries are applying distributed ledger technologies, aka blockchains. A significant number of use cases have been studied in the sectors of logistics, energy markets, smart grid security, and food safety, with frequently reported benefits in transparency, reduced costs, and disintermediation. However, distributed ledger technologies have challenges with transaction throughput, latency, and resource requirements, which render the technology unusable in many cases, particularly with constrained Internet of Things devices.To overcome these challenges within the Industrial Internet of Things, we suggest a set of interledger approaches that enable trusted information exchange across different ledgers and constrained devices. With these approaches, the technically most suitable ledger technology can be selected for each use case while simultaneously enjoying the benefits of the most widespread ledger implementations. We present state of the art for distributed ledger technologies to support the use of interledger approaches in industrial settings. © 2019 IEEE.",Blockchain; Distributed Ledger Technology; Industrial Internet; Internet-of-Things Devices,Blockchain; Digital devices; Hierarchical systems; Internet of things; Smart power grids; Trusted computing; Constrained devices; Hierarchical information; Industrial information systems; Industrial settings; Information exchanges; Resource requirements; Security and trusts; Transaction throughput; Industrial informatics,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 779984",,,"Evans, P.C., Annunziata, M., (2012) Industrial Internet: Pushing the Boundaries; Andoni, M., Robu, V., Flynn, D., Abram, S., Geach, D., Jenkins, D., Mc-Callum, P., Peacock, A., Blockchain technology in the energy sector: A systematic review of challenges and opportunities (2019) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 100, pp. 143-174; Proceedings of the 30th European Conference of the International Telecommunications Society, , Anonymized Anonymized, Helsinki: International telecommunications Society, 2019-06-16/2019-06-29; Jones, C., Tonetti, C., Nonrivalry and the economics of data (2018) Society for Economic Dynamics 2018 Meeting Papers, 477; https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crypto_agility&oldid=887668579, Crypto agility, in Wikipedia Version ID: 887668579, 2019-03-14 (visited on 2019-03-15); Kolias, C., Kambourakis, G., Stavrou, A., Voas, J., DDoS in the IoT: Mirai and other botnets (2017) Computer, 50 (7), pp. 80-84; Lee, J., Bagheri, B., Kao, H.-A., A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4. 0-based manufacturing systems Manufacturing Letters, 3, pp. 18-23. , 2015-01-01; Autiosalo, J., Platform for industrial internet and digital twin focused education, research, and innovation: Ilmatar the overhead crane 2018 IEEE 4th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT), 2018-02, pp. 241-244; Negri, E., Fumagalli, L., Macchi, M., A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems Procedia Manufacturing, 27th International Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing, FAIM2017, 11, pp. 939-948. , Modena, Italy, 27-30 June 2017, 2017-01-01; Kobzan, T., Biendarra, A., Schriegel, S., Herbst, T., Müller, T., Jasperneite, J., Utilizing blockchain technology in industrial manufacturing with the help of network simulation 2018 IEEE 16th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN), pp. 152-159. , 2018-07; Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System, , https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf; Wood, G., Ethereum: A secure decentralised generalised transaction ledger (2014) Ethereum Project Yellow Paper, 151; Ripple-One Frictionless Experience to Send Money Globally, , https://ripple.com/, (visited on 2019-03-20); Hyperledger Fabric, , https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric, (visited on 2019-03-20); Aublin, P.L., Mokhtar, S.B., Quéma, V., RBFT: Redundant byzantine fault tolerance 2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, 2013-07, pp. 297-306; Cachin, C., Vukoli, M., (2017) Blockchain Consensus Protocols in the Wild; Zheng, Z., Xie, S., Dai, H., Chen, X., Wang, H., An overview of blockchain technology: Architecture, consensus, and future trends (2017) 2017 IEEE International Congress on Big Data (BigData Congress), IEEE, pp. 557-564; Korpela, K., Hallikas, J., Dahlberg, T., Digital supply chain transformation toward blockchain integration (2017) Proceedings of the 50th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences; Apte, S., Petrovsky, N., Will blockchain technology revolutionize excipient supply chain management?

To this end, deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks (DNN), deep belief networks (DBN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been successfully applied to forecast the generation and consumption of a wide range of energy vectors. In this work, we show preliminary results for a residential load demand forecasting solution which is realized within the framework of power grid digital twin. To this end, a novel class of deep neural networks is adopted wherein the output of the network is efficiently computed via a black-box ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. We introduce the readers to the main concepts behind this method followed by a real-world, data driven computational benchmark test case designed to study the numerical effectiveness of the proposed approach. Initial results suggest that the ODE based solutions yield acceptable levels of accuracy for wide range of prediction horizons. We conclude that the method could prove as a valuable tool to develop forecasting models within an electrical digital twin (EDT) framework, where, in addition to accurate prediction models, a time horizon independent, computationally scalable and compact model is often desired. © 2019 IEEE.",,Benchmarking;

Under the term Industry 4.0, promising possibilities for high-performance production processes are emerging based on e.g., digital twins and cyber-physical systems. However, the construction industry lags behind in adapting these ideas, and is still facing severe productivity deficits. This paper addresses these deficits by assessing the hypothesis of Building Information Modeling-as the digital twinning methodology in construction-representing a key driver for digital automation and thus enabling more productive processes. To this end, we apply a design science research approach to develop artefacts using computational methods for the automation of business processes in a configure-to-order industry partner. The evaluation is done in the context of a pilot project together with this industry partner. The findings obtained in the pilot project revealed time savings in the phases of bid estimation and work preparation. Based on the findings, the applicability and utility of the suggested approach are discussed and allow for the conclusion that Building Information Model data can usefully streamline and automate many processes at the interface between design and production, if structured and preprocessed purposefully. © 2019 by the authors.",BIM; Configure-to-order; Construction equipment; Cyber-physical production systems; Digital information flow; Digital twins; Industry 4.0; Lean assembly,,,,,,"Libera Università di Bolzano, UNIBZ","sincerely would like to thank the company Niederst?tter, located in South Tyrol, Italy, for giving us the opportunity to carry out the evaluation phase on a pilot project and providing us with valuable data for analysis.

This can be achieved by applying multimodal rehabilitation regimens, such as thought-controlled exoskeletons or epidural electrical stimulation to recover motor pattern generation in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the human neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) system has often been oversimplified in designing rehabilitative and assistive devices. As a result, the neuromechanics of the muscles is seldom considered when modeling the relationship between electrical stimulation, mechanical assistance from exoskeletons, and final joint movement. A powerful way to enhance current neurorehabilitation is to develop the next generation prostheses incorporating personalized NMS models of patients. This strategy will enable an individual voluntary interfacing with multiple electromechanical rehabilitation devices targeting key afferent and efferent systems for functional improvement. This narrative review discusses how real-time NMS models can be integrated with finite element (FE) of musculoskeletal tissues and interface multiple assistive and robotic devices with individuals with SCI to promote neural restoration. In particular, the utility of NMS models for optimizing muscle stimulation patterns, tracking functional improvement, monitoring safety, and providing augmented feedback during exercisebased rehabilitation are discussed. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Lack of data is not the challenge. A wide variety of data is collected, including sensor values, P&IDs, ERP, and depth-based trajectories. Rather, the challenge pertains to data usefulness. The root of the problem is a combination of factors, including poor data infrastructure, incompatible operational data systems, and restricted data access. All this translates to a low maturity of digitalization across the Oil & Gas industry. To date, digitalization efforts have been limited to pilot projects, proofs of concept and case studies, with no large-scale operationalized projects. Aker BP, one of Europe's largest independent Oil & Gas companies, has broken through the typical roadblocks by deploying an industrial data platform across all five of its operational assets. The platform aggregates and processes data from sensors and contextualizes it, structuring it in relation to process diagrams, production information, 3D-models, and event data (maintenance, incidents). Everything linked in the real world is also linked in the platform. This has dramatically reduced the cost of integration and maintenance, while simultaneously enabling scalability, speed of development, and data openness throughout the Aker BP organization. The data platform handles live and historical data for close to 200,000 sensors, with a peak transfer of 800,000 data points per second. Internal and external experts are able to apply state-of-the-art algorithms to visualize and solve critical business problems. A range of third-party applications and data scientists also use the 1+ trillion data points in the platform to create value and support Aker BP's strategy for day-to-day operations and long-term digital transformation. To realize the promise of digitalization, unlocking the value of data must be made a priority within the Oil & Gas industry. This paper will describe the implementation of the industrial data platform, explaining how data streamed from many, disparate, underlying systems is contextualized in the data platform to provide a holistic view of all processes and operations, thus creating a foundational digital twin for each asset, ready to empower machine learning applications for optimization and automatization, as well as human-facing applications, such as advanced visualizations and apps for the digital field worker.

A reliable digital twin of the underground - a realistic, digital representation of the physical world below the surface - is required. Utilities, consisting of the pipes, ducts, cables, manholes and other assets that provide electricity, gas, water, sewerage, and telecommunication services, make up a significant portion of the shallow layers of the subsurface. A lack of reliable information on subsurface utilities may potentially lead to poor decisions leading to undesirable outcomes, lengthy and costly planning and land administration processes, and lengthy, costly, and hazardous development processes. The advent of mobile 3D ground penetrating radar technology offers the promise of non-destructive mapping of existing subsurface utilities in a large area in a relatively short amount of time and could potentially be used to improve the reliability of available information. In this work, a small number of cases studies are described at evaluating the feasibility of a large area mapping approach for subsurface utilities. Based on the results of the studies, a data capture framework for the gradual improvement of the quality of information on existing subsurface utilities is proposed. © Authors 2019.

To improve decision making, a reliable digital twin of the underground is required. Utilities represent a significant portion of physical assets existing underground. Most of these utilities are situated in the relatively shallow layers of the underground, up to a few meters below the surface. The reliable information on subsurface utilities has clear benefits all throughout the life cycle of state land, resulting in efficient decision-making processes, cost savings, and additional revenues for land administration professionals. However, the lack of a reliable map of subsurface utilities lead to ill-informed decisions, costly information gathering, and missed business potential. This paper will share a case study of the 3D underground utility mapping workflow from data capture to usage in Singapore. The new data is collected by the Pegasus: Stream, a mobile mapping platform which captures above and underground data using the photo, laser and ground penetrating radar technology. Based on the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) 3D underground utility data model, the new collected data is used with the existing utility and cadastral data for land administration. This study case expects to explore the reasonable workflow of 3D underground utility mapping to provide reliable information for land administration. © Authors 2019.

Cyber-physical production systems and digital twins of the product and process already provide the means to predict possible future states of the final product, given the current production parameters. With the advent of further data integration coupled with the need for autonomous decision-making, methods are needed to make decisions in real time and in an environment of uncertainty in both the possible outcomes and in the stakeholders' preferences over them. This article proposes a method of autonomous decision-making in data-intensive environments, such as a cyber-physical assembly system. Theoretical results in group decision-making and utility maximization using mixture distributions are presented. This allows us to perform calculations on expected utility accurately and efficiently through closed-form expressions, which are also provided. The practical value of the method is illustrated with a door assembly example and compared to traditional random assembly methods and results. © 2019 SAE International.",,Assembly; Cyber Physical System; Data integration; Industry 4.0; Mixtures; Autonomous decision; Closed-form expression; Current production; Group Decision Making; Mixture distributions; Possible futures; Production system; Utility maximizations; Decision making,,,,,,,,"Kemper, H.G., Fettke, P., Feld, T., Hoffmann, M., Industry 4.0 (2014) Business & Information Systems Engineering, (4), pp. 239-242; Lee, J., Bagheri, B., Kao, H.-A., A Cyber-Physical Systems Architecture for Industry 4.0-Based Manufacturing Systems (2015) Manufacturing Letters, 3, pp. 18-23; Negri, E., Fumagalli, L., MacChi, M., (2017) A Review of the Roles of Digital Twin in CPS-Based Production Systems, , in 27th International Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing, Modena, Italy; Radziwon, A., Bilberg, A., Bogers, M., Madsen, E.S., (2013) The Smart Factory: Exploring Adaptive and Flexible Manufacturing Solutions, , in 24th DAAAM International Symposium on Intelligent Manufacturing and Automation; Hu, S.J., Evolving Paradigms of Manufacturing: From Mass Production to Mass Customization and Personalization (2013) Procedia CIRP, 3 (8); Von, N.J., Morgenstern, O., (1964) Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, , New York, NY, USA: J.

Getting the requirements right early has become a dogma in software engineering because the correction of erroneous or incomplete requirements in later software development phases becomes overly expensive. For product-service systems (PSS), this dogma and standard requirements engineering (RE) approaches are not appropriate because classical RE is considered concluded once a product service is delivered. This paper proposes a novel framework that enables the customer and the product engineer to co-design smart products by integrating three novel and advanced technologies to support: view-based modelling, visualization and monitoring, i.e., Product-Oriented Configuration Language (PoCL), gamification and Complex Event Processing (CEP), respectively. These create a “digital-twin” model of the connected ‘smart’ factory of the future. The framework is formally founded on the novel concept of manufacturing blueprints, which are formalized knowledge-intensive structures that provide the basis for actionable PSS and production “intelligence” and a move toward more fact-based manufacturing decisions. Implementation and validation of the proposed framework through real-life case studies are ongoing to validate the applicability, utility and efficacy of the proposed solutions.

This innovative approach enables manufacturers, utilities and other parties a continuous and efficient use of simulation models within the phases of preliminary investigations, planning, design and operation. It paves the way for the practical implementation of the concept of a digital twin. Besides the technical specification of the process communication, the realization of process synchronization and the model interfaces are comprehensively discussed. Performance topics are practically treated. Finally, as an application of the novel concept, a successfully implemented study in a power system simulation tool is demonstrated in order to prove its practical feasibility. © 2019 IEEE.",Co-Simulation; Digital Twin; Interprocess Communication; Power System Simulation; Shared Memory,Memory architecture; Cosimulation; Design and operations; Interprocess communication; Power system analysis; Power system simulations; Process synchronization; Shared memory; Technical specifications; Digital twin,,,,,,,,"Brosinsky, C., Westermann, D., Krebs, R., Recent and prospective developments in power system control centers: Adapting the digital twin technology for application in power system control centers, in (2018) 2018 IEEE Int.

Synchronicity of different stages and features of the utilities are a key factor in such infrastructure design. The simulation of a project, traditionally based on a static calculation of timetables for transportation connection guarantee, can be done actually with a Digital Twin approach for a whole dynamic simulation of the process. The paper deals with a real case study in which a full intermodal system for minerals transportation, located in a desert, has been fully simulated, with interesting results analysis the for project validation.

The solution integrates the reservoir, completion and surface network, resulting in an efficient model that is readily accessible for daily production optimization. It makes a digital twin for every unconventional well affordable by extensive automation and efficient interface enabling management by exception. In this paper, additional example applications complementing those discussed in SPE 191444 are presented. They include optimization of well-hydraulic fractures positioning in multilayer environment and a quantitative discussion of co-linear versus transverse fracture designs and of the benefits of gas lift optimization. The aim is to illustrate the need/utility for a fast, integrated model that can be used to assist in optimizing the completion and that carry over to production enabling daily production optimization that is practical as opposed to solutions that are too onerous to deploy for every well throughout its lifecycle. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,Digital twin; Daily production; Gas lift optimization; Integrated modeling; Monitoring and control systems; Physics-based models; Production modeling; Surface networks; Unconventional reservoirs; Life cycle,,,,,,The authors would like to thank Emerson Automation Solutions and Maxeur LLC for permission to publish this paper.,,"Ayoub, J.A., Krishnamurthy, S., Blakey, B., Xiong, H., Thambynayagam, R.K.M., Unconventional reservoirs next frontier: Efficient production modeling (2018) The SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, , Dallas, TX, 24-26 Sep; (2017) RSP Permian, , year-end 2016 update; (2016) Trends in US Oil and Natural Gas Upstream Costs, , US Energy Information Administration, eia.

The weather phenomena and new emerging consumer load patterns like electric vehicle contribute to time varying dynamics of these loads. In order to optimize the utilization of system assets and flexibility of DERs, the identification of time varying load dynamics is necessary. In this paper, the identification of time varying load dynamics is explored by combining system identification methods and nonlinear numerical optimization. The identified model parameters are then related to measurement data by means of artificial neural networks, which enables the identification of similar dynamics without opting to numerical optimization methods. © 2020 IEEE.",Digital twin; load modeling; renewable energy sources; smart grid,Digital twin; Electric power transmission networks; Neural networks; Numerical methods; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Combining systems; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution grid; Measurement based model; Nonlinear numerical optimization; Numerical optimizations; Time varying loads; Time-varying dynamics; Dynamics,,,,,"Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi: 0350008",This research has been funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) under the agreement no. 0350008 (Smart Grid Cyber-Resilience Lab).,,"Grieves, M.W., Virtually intelligent product systems: Digital and physical twins (2019) Complex Systems Engineering: Theory and Practice, pp. 175-200; D'Amico, D., Ekoyuncu, J., Addepalli, S., Smith, C., Keedwell, E., Conceptual framework of a digital twin to evaluate the degradation status of complex engineering systems (2019) Procedia Cirp, 86, pp. 61-67; Moutis, P., Mousavi, O., Digital twin of distribution power transformer for real-time monitoring of medium voltage from low voltage measurements (2020) IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Pan, H., Dou, Z., Cai, Y., Li, W., Lei, X., Han, D., Digital twin and its application in power system (2020) 2020 5th International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy (ICPRE), pp. 21-26; Babazadeh, D., Chenine, M., Nordstrom, L., Survey on the factors required in design of communication architecture for future dc grids (2013) Ifac Proceedings Volumes, 46 (6), pp. 58-63; Kovalyov, S.P., Information architecture of the power system digital twin (2020) Sistemy I Sredstva Informatiki [Systems and Means of Informatics], 30 (1), pp. 66-81; Zolin, D., Ryzhkova, E., Digital twins for electric grids (2020) 2020 International Russian Automation Conference (RusAutoCon), pp. 175-180; Laaki, H., Miche, Y., Tammi, K., Prototyping a digital twin for real time remote control over mobile networks: Application of remote surgery (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 20325-20336; Babazadeh, D., Hertem, D.V., Nordstrom, L., Study of centralized and distributed coordination of power injection in multi-tso hvdc grid with large off-shore wind integration (2016) Electric Power Systems Research, 136, pp. 281-288; Zhou, M., Yan, J., Feng, D., Digital twin framework and its application to power grid online analysis (2019) Csee Journal of Power and Energy Systems, 5 (3), pp. 391-398; Brosinsky, C., Westermann, D., Krebs, R., Recent and prospective developments in power system control centers: Adapting the digital twin technology for application in power system control centers (2018) 2018 IEEE International Energy Conference (ENERGYCON), pp. 1-6; Baboli, P.T., Babazadeh, D., Siagkas, D., Manikas, S., Anastasakis, K., Merino, J., Experiences with system-level validation approach (2020) European Guide to Power System Testing, pp. 105-112. , Springer; Lund, A.M., Mochel, K., Lin, J.-W., Onetto, R., Srinivasan, J., Gregg, P., Bergman, J.E., Chotai, S., Digital Twin Interface for Operating Wind Farms, , Jun. 12 2018, uS Patent 9, 995, 278; Hewitt, S., Margetts, L., Revell, A., Building a digital wind farm (2018) Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, 25 (4), pp. 879-899; Madni, A.M., Madni, C.C., Lucero, S.D., Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering (2019) Systems, 7 (1), p. 7; Stark, R., Fresemann, C., Lindow, K., Development and operation of digital twins for technical systems and services (2019) Cirp Annals, 68 (1), pp. 129-132; Song, X., Cai, H., Kircheis, J., Jiang, T., Schlegel, S., Westermann, D., Application of digital twin assistant-system in state estimation for inverter dominated grid (2020) 2020 55th International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC), pp. 1-6; Atalay, M., Angin, P., A digital twins approach to smart grid security testing and standardization (2020) 2020 IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for Industry 4.0 & IoT.

For automated import of load flow data in the digital twin a Python interface is programmed. The Python interface handles the import of the measurement data from the power grid monitoring software GridVis, which is the data management tool used by the distribution system operator, to the real-time digital simulator. After the successful implementation of the grid section in the real-time digital simulator as well as the automated data transfer, the load flow in RSCAD is validated by comparison of the load flow results of a corresponding offline load flow grid model in PSS™SINCAL.

A distribution subsystem comprises a CPS (Cyber Physical System) where the Cyber part is enabled by a low latency IIoT network and computational resources at the edge (distribution grid subsystem controller) while the physical system is represented (Digital Twin) by a hybrid model of the grid: a data driven machine learning representation of a limited number of nodes, along with a discrete-time model-based transient state estimator which captures the near real time physical operation of the grid. In case of early warning measurements acquired through the IIoT, machine learning edge computations can detect the severity of the warning, identify the network area of interest while ignite the execution of the transient state estimation. The transient state estimation predicts the incoming failure in near real time while the timing window allows possible preventive actuation. © 2020 IEEE.",edge computing; fault prediction; industrial cyber physical system; neural networks; real time; smart grid; transient state estimation,Cyber Physical System; Digital twin; Electric power system control; Embedded systems; Energy resources; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Machine learning; Outages; Smart power grids; State estimation; Computational resources; Discrete-time model; Distributed energy resource; Distribution grid; Failure prediction; Operational complexity; Physical systems; Subsystem controllers; Electric power transmission networks,,,,,"5021446, 5038640",The work of A.

Although current top-down building energy benchmarking approaches are useful for identifying overall efficient and poor performers across a portfolio of buildings at a city scale, they are limited in their ability to provide actionable insights regarding efficiency opportunities. Concurrently, advances in smart metering data analytics combined with new data streams available via smart metering infrastructure present the opportunity to incorporate previously undetectable temporal fluctuations into top-down building benchmarking analyses. This paper leveraged smart meter electricity data to develop daily building energy benchmarks segmented by strategic periods to quantify their variation from conventional, annual energy benchmarking strategies and investigate how such metrics can lead to near real-time energy management. The periods considered include occupied periods during the school year, unoccupied periods during the school year, occupied periods during the summer, unoccupied periods during the summer, and peak summer demand periods. Results showed that temporally segmented building energy benchmarks are distinct from a building's overall benchmark. This demonstrates that a building's overall benchmark masks periods in which a building is over- or underperforming during the day, week, or month; thus, temporally segmented energy benchmarks can provide a more specific and accurate measure for building efficiency. We discussed how these findings establish the foundation for digital twin-enabled urban energy management platforms by enabling identification of building retrofit strategies and near-real-time efficiency in the context of the performance of an entire building portfolio. Temporally segmented energy benchmarking measures generated from smart meter data streams are a critical step for integrating smart meter analytics with building energy benchmarking techniques, and for conducting smarter energy management across a large geographic scale of buildings. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Building energy benchmarking; Commercial buildings; Community energy-efficiency; Digital twin; Energy management; Smart city,Benchmarking; Data Analytics; Electric measuring instruments; Electric power measurement; Energy management; Office buildings; Smart city; Smart meters; Building efficiency; Building energy; Building energy performance; Commercial building; Digital twin; Energy benchmarking; Management platforms; Temporal fluctuation; Energy efficiency,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1837021","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

The technological architecture was designed to implement the proposed framework, and multi-level demand response models were developed based on machine, shop-floor and factory to save energy cost. Finally, an application of ball mills in a slurry shop-floor of a partner company was presented to demonstrate the proposed framework and models. Results showed that the energy efficiency of ball mills can be greatly improved. The energy cost of the slurry shop-floor saved approximately 19.33% by considering electricity demand response using particle swarm optimisation. This study provides a practical approach to make effective and energy-efficient decisions for energy-intensive manufacturing enterprises. © 2020 The Author(s)",Circular economy; Data-driven; Demand response; Energy-intensive industries; Particle swarm optimisation; Sustainable intelligent manufacturing,Advanced Analytics; Ball mills; Data Analytics; Digital twin; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Floors; Manufacture; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pollution control; Advanced technology; Cleaner production; Electricity demand response; Energy intensive industries; Energy intensive manufacturing; Intelligent Manufacturing; Particle swarm optimisation; Technological architectures; Industrial economics,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 775970; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51475096, 51675441, 51705428, U1501248; Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU: 91352, B13044; Horizon 2020; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities: 31020190505001; Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project","The work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51675441 , 51475096 , U1501248 , 51705428 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 31020190505001 ), the 111 Project Grant of Northwestern Polytechnical University ( B13044 ), and FlexSUS: Flexibility for Smart Urban Energy Systems (Project No. 91352 ), which has received funding in the framework of the joint programming initiative ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems’ focus initiative Integrated, Regional Energy Systems, with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 775970 .

Smart cities must be large towns able to sustain the needs of their citizens while promoting environmental sustainability. Smart cities foment the widespread use of novel information and communication technologies (ICTs); however, experimenting with these technologies in such a large geographical area is unfeasible. Consequently, smart campuses (SCs), which are universities where technological devices and applications create new experiences or services and facilitate operational efficiency, allow experimentation on a smaller scale, the concept of SCs as a testbed for a smart city is gaining momentum in the research community. Nevertheless, while universities acknowledge the academic role of a smart and sustainable approach to higher education, campus life and other student activities remain a mystery, which have never been universally solved. This paper proposes a SC concept to investigate the integration of building information modeling tools with Internet of Things-(IoT)-based wireless sensor networks in the fields of environmental monitoring and emotion detection to provide insights into the level of comfort. Additionally, it explores the ability of universities to contribute to local sustainability projects by sharing knowledge and experience across a multi-disciplinary team. Preliminary results highlight the significance of monitoring workspaces because productivity has been proven to be directly influenced by environment parameters. The comfort-monitoring infrastructure could also be reused to monitor physical parameters from educational premises to increase energy efficiency. © 2020 by the authors.

Ships have been operating at reduced speeds in recent years and, the liner temperatures of marine diesel engines vary significantly at reduced loads, which increase the heat loss from main engine. The research focuses on revealing the energy efficiency enhancement potential by decreasing heat loss through jacket water during reduced loads without any permanent modification. The heat loss reduction is achieved by means of higher coolant (glycol–water mixture) temperatures, to keep the liner temperatures at their maximum permissible temperatures. The methodology is calculating the energy balance and efficiency increment at reduced loads of main engine by modelling. The model have been validated with the digital twin of a two-stroke Sulzer-12RTA84C marine diesel engine. The simulated results comprise in-cylinder pressures, exhaust gas temperature and pressure, scavenge pressure, engine speed, turbo-charger, indicated power and heat transfer rate. Liner temperatures, affecting the heat transfer rate, are investigated in variable operating loads of the main engine. The study shows that keeping the liner temperature of the engine at the maximum continuous rating's temperature, has respectable efficiency advantages under different operating loads. 0.5% reduction in fuel consumption could be achieved, coming with 127.8 tons fuel and 398 tons CO2 reduction in a year. Additionally, waste heat recovery system calculations were carried out and additional 48.8 tons of fuel could be saved in the generation of electricity. In total 176.6 tons of fuel and 550 tons of CO2 emission reduction could be achieved. As a result, the controlled cylinder wall temperatures can be considered as one of the methods to solve the efficiency and emission problems in ships in the near future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Cylinder liner temperature; Energy efficiency; Engine cooling; Low heat rejection; Marine diesel engine model; Thermal energy management,Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Digital twin; Emission control; Engine cylinders; Fuels; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Marine engines; Ships; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; CO2 emission reduction; Cylinder wall temperature; Efficiency enhancement; Exhaust gas temperatures; International regulations; Maximum continuous ratings; Operational techniques; Waste heat recovery systems; Energy efficiency,,,,,,,,"UNCTAD, Review of maritime transport (2018), pp. 404-406. , United Nations Publications; IMO (International Maritime Organization), (2014) Third IMO greenhouse gas study 2014 – executive summary, pp. 1-26; (International Maritime Organization) IMO, Interim guidelines on the method of calculation of the energy efficiency design index for new ships.

Cost pressure and environmental compliances sensitize facility operators for energy and resource efficiency within the whole life cycle while achieving reliability requirements. In manufacturing systems, technical building services (TBS) such as cooling towers (CT) are drivers of resource demands while they fulfil a vital mission to keep the production running. Data-driven approaches, such as data mining (DM), help to support operators in their daily business. Within this paper the development of a data-driven DT for TBS operation is presented and applied on an industrial CT case study located in Germany. It aims to improve system understanding and performance prediction as essentials for a successful operational management. The approach comprises seven consecutive steps in a broadly applicable workflow based on the CRISP-DM paradigm. Step by step, the workflow is explained including a tailored data pre-processing, transformation and aggregation as well as feature selection procedure. The graphical presentation of interim results in portfolio diagrams, heat maps and Sankey diagrams amongst others to enhance the intuitive understanding of the procedure. The comparative evaluation of selected DM algorithms confirms a high prediction accuracy for cooling capacity (R2 = 0.96) by using polynomial regression and electric power demand (R2 = 0.99) by linear regression. The results are evaluated graphically and the transfer into industrial practice is discussed conclusively. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

LNG carriers are inherently complex vessels, featuring a high degree of integration of their energy conversion systems, all operating under time and load varying mission profiles, making design decisions non-trivial. To this end, DNVGL COSSMOS (Complex Ship Systems Modelling and Simulation) in-house process modelling framework is used to build digital twins of the propulsion and cargo module of LNG carriers, modelling the entire energy conversion process from cargo tanks to useful energy required for propulsion, electricity and heat. Emphasis is given on reliquefaction systems and the improvement they provide in performance, comparing the currently available technologies and giving deeper insight for the Joule-Thomson systems. The overall ship system performance is improved by 5–15% along the low vessel speed range and 25–40% for the anchorage loaded port condition, when partial reliquefaction systems are considered, depending on the configuration they are compared to. Engine technology also plays an important role, with high-pressure engines exhibiting 3–10% better performance, depending on the reliquefaction technology coupled with, along the high vessel speed range, mainly because of their inherent better performance. © 2020",Efficiency; Integrated marine energy systems; Joule-thomson; LNG carrier; Partial reliquefaction; Performance; Reliquefaction,Commerce; Efficiency; Energy conversion; Engines; Heating; Natural gas transportation; Natural gasoline plants; Sailing vessels; Ship conversion; Ship propulsion; Ships; Transportation routes; Joule-Thomson; LNG carriers; Marine energy systems; Performance; Reliquefaction; Liquefied natural gas; algorithm; comparative study; electricity generation; energy efficiency; heat flux; liquefaction; liquefied natural gas; performance assessment; shipping,,,,,,,,"Majo, D., Alappat, B.A.B., Sreekanth Sarma, P.V., Aravind, M., Kiran, M., Process modelling and validation of LNG reliquefaction (2018) Global Res Develop J Eng, 3 (2). , January; Gómez, J.R., Gómez, M.R., Garcia, R.F., Catoira, A., On board LNG reliquefaction technology: a comparative study (2013) Pol Marit Res, 21 (1), pp. 77-88; Chang, H.-M., A thermodynamic review of cryogenic cycles for liquefaction of natural gas (2015), 72, pp. 127-147. , Elsevier Cryogenic; Kim, D., Hwang, C., Gundersen, T., Lim, Y., (2019) Process design and economic optimization of boil-off gas reliquefaction systems for LNG carriers, 173, pp. 1119-1129. , Elsevier Energy; Jauhari, T.K., Maimun, A., Siow, C.L., Review of systems engineering methods, techniques and tools for ship design as large and complex systems (2019), International Congress and Conferences on Computational Design and Engineering Malaysia; Lepistö, V., Lappalainen, J., Sillanpää, K., Ahtila, P., , 111, pp. 43-55. , Dynamic process simulation promotes energy efficient ship design.

Federated learning enables clients to collaboratively train models without sharing data. Meanwhile, digital twins provide environmental awareness and autonomous management, which in combination with federated learning reconciles the conflict between privacy protection and data training in air-ground network. In this paper, we consider dynamic digital twin and federated learning for air-ground networks where drone works as the aggregator and the ground clients collaboratively train the model based on the network dynamics captured by digital twins. We design incentives for federated learning based on Stackelberg game, in which the digital twin of the drone acts as the leader to set preferences for clients, and clients as followers choose the global training rounds after weighing benefits and costs. Furthermore, considering the varying digital twin deviations and network dynamics during the federated learning process, we design a dynamic incentive scheme to adaptively adjust the selection of the optimal clients and their participation level. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes can significantly improve accuracy and energy efficiency.

The strong point of the proposed design is that it can be personalized according to the specific needs of the building. The building and the air conditioning system has been evaluated according to the first and second law of thermodynamics. In particular, different options have been considered by a holistic method that aims to produce arbitrary system configurations such as Industry 4.0 Digital Twin and constructal law based design. The building system has been studied by considering the climatic data in the location of Bologna (Italy). The solar contribution has been analysed monthly. The solar gains by transparent elements have been estimated. The resulting configuration produces the design of an innovative building. It benefits from three qualifying elements. Sandwich walls include high-efficiency Vacuum Insulated Panels (VIP) for minimizing heat dispersions. The evaluation of seasonal shading has allowed optimizing smart windows. An innovative cogeneration heat pump couples solar energy and heating–cooling by mean of thermoelectric effect with heat recovery from photovoltaic systems. The acclimatization is realized by Peltier cells and heat recovery (during winter) from photovoltaic modules. A complete analysis and dimensioning of the building and heat pump is provided, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Container house; Heat pump; Indoor acclimatization; Peltier cell; Renewable; Solar; Thermoelectric,Air conditioning; Architectural design; Containers; Cooling systems; Digital twin; Heat pump systems; Heating; Houses; Molecular biology; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Pumps; Solar buildings; Solar cells; Solar energy; Waste heat; Heat pumps; Indoor acclimatization; Peltier cell; Renewable; Solar; Thermoelectric; Energy efficiency,,,,,"Universidade da Beira Interior, UBI","The research in the paper is part of the research activity developed jointly by Ethical Property Management Italia S.r.l.

The problem with their processing is acute in the regions of the Russian Arctic shelf, where a large number of mining and processing plants are concentrated; therefore, the study and creation of energy-efficient systems for ore waste disposal is an urgent scientific problem. The subject of the study is the infoware for monitoring phosphorus production. The applied study methods are based on systems theory and system analysis, technical cybernetics, machine learning technologies as well as numerical experiments. The usage of “digital twin” elements to increase the energy and resource efficiency of phosphorus production is determined by the desire to minimize the costs of production modernization by introducing advanced algorithms and computer architectures. The algorithmic part of the proposed tools for energy and resource efficiency optimization is based on the deep neural network apparatus and a previously developed mathematical description of the thermophysical, thermodynamic, chemical, and hydrodynamic processes occurring in the phosphorus production system. The ensemble application of deep neural networks allows for multichannel control over the phosphorus technology process and the implementation of continuous additional training for the networks during the technological system operation, creating a high-precision digital copy, which is used to determine control actions and optimize energy and resource consumption. Algorithmic and software elements are developed for the digital environment, and the results of simulation experiments are presented. The main contribution of the conducted research consists of the proposed structure for technological information processing to optimize the phosphorus production system according to the criteria of energy and resource efficiency, as well as the developed software that implements the optimization parameters of this system. © 2020 by the authors.

The digital environment is based on solutions to optimize the energy and resource efficiency of CETS. such computational intelligence methods as deep neural networks, which make it possible to conduct automated deep analysis for large volumes of technological data. A significant number of optimization parameters leads to a polyextremity of the response surface of the optimality criterion (total energy consumption by the technological system); therefore, to ensure global optimization, simple enumeration of the criterion values at various parameter combinations was used. The contribution of the presented studies to the information support of CETS lies in the developed structure and software of the DTE, which allows for optimizing CETS functioning according to energy and resource efficiency. The results of the numerical experiment demonstrate the capabilities of the created software and the efficiency of the proposed multistage optimization procedure.

Most of them are connected to platforms for monitoring data and notifying anomalies, but few are integrated within building elements (either for data collection or response). These technologies help regulate HVAC, or detect building systems’ failures, but few enable passive sustainable strategies or space maintenance. It is possible to enhance building responsive operation by gathering granular data on passive systems’ operation and space occupation by setting a building component, that houses a sensor network.

Evolving it to high-fidelity digital twin is desirable for the management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing automatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models apply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined parameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches impractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration by iterating four key steps of i) training a neural surrogate model based on CFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters at the moment through neural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring the found parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using sensor-measured data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is offloaded to the neural surrogate which is ultra-faster than CFD model's iterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate prior knowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate design to improve its learning efficiency. With about five hours computation on a 32-core processor, Kalibre achieves mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.81°C and 0.75°C in calibrating two CFD models for two production data halls hosting thousands of servers each while requires fewer CFD solving processes than existing baseline approaches. © 2020 ACM.",CFD; Data center; Digital twin; Knowledge-based neural net; Surrogate model,Digital twin; Energy efficiency; Intelligent buildings; Knowledge based systems; Automatic calibration; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Computational model; Large scale data; Learning efficiency; Mean absolute error; Optimal parameter; Surrogate approach; Computational fluid dynamics,,,,,"National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Info-communications Media Development Authority, IMDA","This work is funded by National Research Foundation (NRF) via the Green Data Centre Research (GDCR) and the Green Buildings Innovation Cluster (GBIC), administered by Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Building and Construction Authority (BCA) respectively.",,"https://www.futurefacilities.com, [n.d.]. 6SigmaDCX; http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/serviceProvider/global-cloud-index-gci/Cloud-Index-WhitePaper.html, [n.d.].

With the development of digital technologies, it is possible to collect data about the process directly during the production. This data can be used both for direct control of the process, and for building (adjusting) the model of the process, which allows to get a ""digital twin""repeating both the main properties of the modeled object and its current state. Many complex manufacturing processes involve a set of different interconnected models. In this case, the ""digital twin""should contain information about the object characteristics, individual models of its functioning, the connections between these models, and the current state. These processes include many stages of metallurgical production. The paper considers complex modeling of the casting process in continuous steel casting unit. The set of models includes a model of the thermal state of the ingot during casting, a model of the stress-strain state, a model of the melt hydrodynamics, structural and concentration models of the ingot. Mathematical models of thermal and stress-strain states and the connections between them are presented.

Therefore,volatility of the energy market increases. This requires major industrial energy consumers to adapt their mode of operation in terms of flexibilization as a measure of power grid stabilization. The high potential of flexibly operated air separation units (ASU) is investigated within the project “Kopernikus SynErgie FlexASU”, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The development of a detailed dynamic simulation model of an ASU, which is called digital twin, is a major step towards flexible plant operation. The digital twin needs to be capable of accurately simulating the whole operating range of an ASU, including start-up, load change and shutdown procedures. In order to guarantee the required simulation accuracy, the pressure-driven approach according to Thomas et al. 2020 is used for dynamic simulation [1].Kender et al. 2019 introduced a digital twin of an ASU without argon production based on the pressure-driven approach and presented simulation results of a warm plant start-up [2]. One crucial part of an energy efficient ASU operation is thermal integration, which is realized by a network of heat exchangers. Therefore, detailed heat exchanger models are required for a digital twin of an ASU in order to ensure an accurate prediction of the dominant time scales of thermal integration. In this work the dynamic simulation of heat exchangers with the pressure-driven approach according to Thomas et al. 2020 is presented. A detailed, generic heat exchanger model is described, which consists of process stream as well as metal heat capacity modules. This digital twin of a heat exchanger enables the simulation of different types, e.g. plate-fin, coil-wound or shell and tube heat exchangers. Design correlations for pressure drop and heat transfer are included. This allows for a physically correct prediction of heat exchanger behavior and dynamic simulations close to reality. In addition, a lot of heat exchangers contain condensing or evaporating process streams. Therefore, phase change phenomena occur, which lead to discontinuous design correlations and numerical instabilities. This work addresses a stable numerical treatment of the discontinuous set of model equations. Furthermore, the impact of highly transient plant operation scenarios on different heat exchangers is presented based on dynamic simulations. Copyright © American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Yet, algorithms and methodological approaches for improvement of energy consumption and environmental impact are not integrated with the current operational and planning tools used by manufacturing companies. One possible reason for this is the difficulty in bridging the gap between the most advanced energy related ICT tools, developed within the scope of the industry 4.0 era, and the legacy systems that support most manufacturing operational and planning processes. Consequently, this paper proposes a conceptual architecture model for a digital energy management platform, which is comprised of an IIoT-based platform, strongly supported by energy digital twin for interoperability and integrated with AI-based energy data-driven services. This conceptual architecture model enables companies to analyse their energy consumption behaviour, which allows for the understanding of the synergies among the variables that affect the energy demand, and to integrate this energy intelligence with their legacy systems in order to achieve a more sustainable energy demand. © 2020 The Authors.

Smooth operation of such segments requires high level of unification and automation for such procedures as information exchange between participants of management cycles, optimal operation planning for equipment included into physical or virtual groups, clearing of financial transactions, etc. In order to meet such requirements with minimal time and labor, it is proposed to compose and operate applied control systems within the framework of a digital platform. The platform architecture is presented based upon reusable functional microservices, viz. small, loosely connected, and easily modifiable components with an open application program interface, that interact in a unified information environment. Applications that automate various business functions of smart distributed energy control are composed from calls to microservices, adapters of interaction with external systems, and graphical user interface. Algorithms are presented as part of the platform's mathematical means, for automatic modeling and analyzing electrical modes, forecasting load/generation and external technical and economic factors, and solving optimization control problems. Procedures for composing and operating digital twins of smart distributed energy objects over the platform's data bases and streams are described. © 2020 IEEE.",digital platform; load and generation forecast; optimal equipment operation planning; smart distributed energy,Application programs; Automation; Computer software reusability; Control systems; Data streams; Digital storage; Digital twin; Electric load forecasting; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Graphical user interfaces; Information management; Application program interfaces; Distributed energy sources; Efficient managements; Financial transactions; Information environment; Information exchanges; Optimization control; Platform architecture; Electric power system control,,,,,34/19gr,"This research is supported by the NTI Fund, contract No. 34/19gr.",,"(2019) Global Energy Transformation: A Roadmap to 2050.

Due to specific constraints in terms of service continuity and indoor air quality, the demand is at a large extent constant during the day and throughout the year. Indeed, a healthcare facility must fulfil several different activities. Medical equipment needs electric energy, while the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems require thermal energy. It is extremely difficult to define reference characteristics for the energy demand, since the proportions of the different consumptions are strongly connected with the specific activities/services carried out within each structure. The present work aims at analysing the energy demand of a healthcare facility located near Firenze (Italy). The energy demand has been analysed by means of the available documentation to get a basic knowledge of the expected consumption of each component of the facility. These data have been then correlated with information on the actual healthcare activity parameters (e.g. staff in service, medical services) and on weather conditions. As a result, the study led to the definition of the principal energy drivers that characterize the Healthcare Facility. The analysis procedure is thought of general interest for the community working in the field, representing a benchmark for the calibration of energy digital twins and a reference data set useful to carry out building energy efficiency optimization strategies. © 2020 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,Air conditioning; Air quality; Digital twin; Energy management; Health care; Indoor air pollution; Building energy efficiency; Electric energies; Healthcare facility; Indoor air quality; Medical services; Specific activity; Strongly connected; Terms of services; Energy efficiency,,,,,,,,"Shen, C., Zhao, K., Ge, J., Zhou, Q., Analysis of Building Energy Consumption in a Hospital in the Hot Summer and Cold Winter Area (2019) Energy Procedia, 158 (2019), pp. 3735-3740; Eckelman, M.J., Sherman, J., Environmental Impacts of the U.S. Health Care System and Effects on Public Health (2016) Plos One, 11 (6), p. 0157014; Garcia-Sanz-Calcedo, J., Gòmez-Chaparro, M., Sanchez-Barroso, G., Electrical and thermal energy in private hospitals: Consumption indicators focused on healthcare activity (2019) Sustainable Cities and Society, 47 (2019), pp. 101-482; Stockwell, R.E., Ballard, E.L., O'Rourke, P., Knibbs, L.D., Morawska, L., Bell, S.C., Indoor hospital air and the impact of ventilation on bioaerosols: A systematic review (2019) Hospital Infection, 103 (2), pp. 175-184; Skoog, J., Fransson, N., Jagemar, L., Thermal environment in Swedish hospitals.

To address this issue, in this paper, a novel traffic-flow adaptive scheme of smart lighting systems is proposed on the basis of the cyber-physical cloud system. The cyber-physical cloud system consists of the digital twin and cyber-physical system. The operation of the lighting system is simulated in the counterpart twin system with the digital twin technology. The cyber-physical system realizes data collection, information interaction, analysis, and processing, as well as complex computation and remote control.

A specific feature of the development of offshore oil fields is the difficulty of ensuring significant ‘flexibility’ of power supply systems for the entire OHS fleet, allowing to quickly meet the needs and changes in the technological scheme of development, construction, methods of field exploitation, while having the capacity and reserves corresponding to the current state. In order to ensure continuous production, Vietsovpetro JV has created a unique, energy-efficient, autonomous power supply system for hydraulic structures-the United Power Grid (UPG). UPG energy efficiency was achieved through the implementation of utilization system for associated gas, treated as fuel for the energy hub turbine generators. The article describes the main elements of UPG, incorporated limiting systems for short-circuit currents and power factor compensation. The introduction of the UPG made it possible to increase the utilization rate of associated gas, reduce op-erating costs, and improve the quality and reliability of electricity supply, while the Digital Twin for UPG allowed significantly reduce the time, optimize oper-ating and capital costs during an upgrade and development of the energy system. The article covers the stages of UPG creation, its current state and describes the generating-consuming balance for electricity at the steady run. The paper presents the actual data on production costs reduction and provides for the system development perspective – power supply of mobile offshore structures, complete implementation of operational dispatching management system and integration of the advanced M&R system for energy equipment based on actual condition, resulting in significant reduction of losses in production costs. © 2020, Neftyanoe Khozyaistvo.

In metal remelting applications, the current practice relies heavily on operator experience to determine when the material inside the furnace has reached tapping temperature. Recycling companies are therefore at the mercy of the skill and inclination of their operators. This, combined with the significant variability that is inherent in the remelting process, can often lead to suboptimal performance and inconsistent results, contributing to longer cycle times, reduced energy efficiency, and increased aluminum losses. Using a digital twin methodology, key performance and operational parameters are logged over time and used to create a digital model of the melting process, where historical and real-time data are utilized to create a mass-energy balance, calculating when the metal has reached the target temperature. Real-time feedback provides operators with information on when the aluminum is ready for tapping. As new data continues to feed into the model, the model predictions improve over time. A digital twin model was developed and implemented on a tilt rotary furnace (TRF) used to remelt aluminum dross materials. Data was analyzed to determine aluminum oxidation losses over a large number of cycles and regression analysis showed an exponential relationship between yield loss and metal tapping temperature. Baseline data was compared with data from cycles that were completed using the digital twin, which found that an accurate model of end-or-melt prediction, combined with timely burner shutdown control, can provide significant benefits in production and yield, as well as energy savings. © 2020 Fellom Publishing Company.

This results in an increasing demand for automation solutions with high quality requirements that are well integrated with process engineering and equipment specification. Integrated planning of automation technology in combination with mechanical equipment and process engineering requires the use of simulation tools in planning. A once existing simulation model of a plant can then not only be used for planning and optimization, but also for further questions about the life cycle of the plant. The automation concept simulated during the planning can be used, for example, as a precise requirement specification for the programming of the automation.

Therefore, rigid body dynamic models become obsolete and the need for new dynamic models accounting for the flexibility of industrial manipulators emerges. To this end, a physics-based approach considering the flexibility of robots' links and gearboxes is presented. In particular, this paper intends to provide a framework for modelling flexible robotic structures' towards increasing their accuracy. The robot components' elasticity is introduced in a lumped parameters model by pairs of springs and dampers, the number of which is affected by the target of keeping the computational effort and run time of the simulation at levels allowing for the integration of the model in industrial environments. Finally, the proposed model considers the activation of the robots' Digital Twins aiming to enable the use of the model in a series of applications e.g. predictive maintenance, energy efficiency optimization etc. © 2020 Elsevier B.V..

It is very challenging to ascertain the real performance in such applications due to changing specific energy consumption. The paper presents development of a novel and robust monitoring system, enabling realtime energy performance monitoring of dynamic compression and revealing realistic opportunities for energy savings. The methodology comprised review of design and OEM data for the compression units, followed by review of operating envelope. Subsequently, developed a thermodynamic model of compression units encompassing all the operating modes. Then embedded the actual performance curves from OEM in the thermodynamic digital twin and validated the model with actual operating data. Carried out site visits and held discussions with technical teams as part of the comprehensive approach. A mathematical model additionally developed, in addition to the thermodynamic model, to enable operators for off-line monitoring of the compressors performance during unavailability of thermodynamic digital twin. Detailed performance analysis of centrifugal compressors is essential to ascertain their condition and functioning. A decrease in performance can be an indication of internal wear or fouling, which if allowed to continue, may result in reduced throughput or excessive energy consumption or even unscheduled outages. Thus, the performance is not just an indication of energy or operating cost but also reflects other vital aspects like reliability. The integrated thermodynamic digital twin developed for large sales gas compression units, with total throughput capacity of more than 500 MMSCFD, has enabled and demonstrated effective energy performance monitoring even with changing operating scenarios. It facilitated real-time comparison of actual performance (specific energy consumption) with model based expected performance. It also aided real-time trending of polytropic efficiency as well as real-time display of potential energy savings opportunities. The digital twin has proven to be a reliable and low cost tool to predict compressor performance for various operating modes on real time basis. The data from the compression digital twin can be tied into process simulation models for process optimization. The model can complement supervisory capabilities, diagnostics, control capabilities and even facilitate in predicting failures ahead of time. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,Centrifugal compressors; Data compression; Digital integrated circuits; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gasoline; Mathematical operators; Optimization; Potential energy; Thermodynamic properties; Compressor performance; Control capabilities; Dynamic compression; Performance analysis; Polytropic efficiency; Process simulation model; Specific energy consumption; Throughput capacities; Digital twin,,,,,,,,"https://www.pumpsandsystems.com/evaluating-centrifugal-compressor-field-performance; https://www.turbomachinerymag.com/centrifugal-compressor-perfomance/; Chaoweia, b, Xuezhia, Dong, Xiyanga, Liu, Zhiganga, Sun, Shixuna, Wu, Qinga, Gao, Chunqing, Tan, ""A method to select loss correlations for centrifugal compressor performance prediction"" (2019) Aerospace Science and Technology, 93. , b, b; Radika Lucas, A, Andy Jones, B C, Wesley Ford, A, Matt Doyle, B, The effective use of data analytics in an advanced compressor performance and degradation monitoring system (2018) The APPEA Journal, 58 (2)",,,,Society of Petroleum Engineers,"Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2020, ADIP 2020",9 November 2020 through 12 November 2020,,165204,,9.78E+12,,,,,,,,,

This type of research focuses either on the restriction of power consumption of the devices of a data center, or on the minimization of energy exchange between the data center space as a whole and its environment. The work presented here focuses mainly on the latter. In particular, we attempt to estimate the effect that can infer on the energy performance of a data room, various interventions on the structural envelop of the building that hosts the data center. The performance of the data center is evaluated in this work by measuring its PUE index. Our modeling methodology includes the selection of a proper simulation tool for the creation of the digital twin, that is of a digital clone, of our real data center, and then building its thermal model via energy measurements. In this work, the researchers exploit the potential of EnergyPlus software for modelling and simulating the behavior of a data center space. The energy measurements were conducted for a long period, using low cost IoT infrastructure, in the data center space of an Educational building in Heraklion Crete.

Suitable tools are needed that can harness advanced control and machine learning techniques to achieve environmental, economic and resilience objectives. In this paper, an energy management tool is presented that can offer optimal control, scheduling, forecasting and coordination services to energy assets across a district, enabling optimal decisions under user-defined objectives. The tool presented here can coordinate different sub-systems in a district to avoid the violation of high-level system constraints and is designed in a generic fashion to enable transferable use across different energy sectors. The work demonstrates the potential for a single open-source optimisation framework to be applied across multiple energy vectors, providing local government the opportunity to manage different assets in a coordinated fashion. This is shown through case studies that integrate low-carbon communal heating for social housing with electric vehicle charge-point management to achieve high-level system constraints and local government objectives in the borough of Greenwich, London. The paper illustrates the theoretical methodology, the software architecture and the digital twin-based testing environment underpinning the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Building energy; Machine learning; Smart cities; Transport energy; Urban energy systems,Digital twin; Energy management; Internet of things; Open source software; Scheduling; Software testing; Vector control (Electric machinery); Coordination and Control; High-level systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine learning techniques; Optimal controls; Optimal decisions; Smart energy systems; Testing environment; Learning systems,,,,,"EP/S016627/1; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 691895; Greater London Authority, GLA; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Horizon 2020","This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 691895 and the EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences) under the Active Building Centre project (reference number: EP/S016627/1).

Based on the system state equation methodology, the dual real-virtual system representation for parallel systems is presented, based on which the parallel system problem is described in mathematical forms. Further, the computational framework for the ACP approach, which explain in details the mathematical processes for artificial systems (A), computational experiments (C) and parallel execution (P). Based on the ACP approach framework, concepts such as ""learning and training"", ""experiments and evaluation"", ""management and control"" are mapped into ACP's mathematical computational framework, as well as related concepts such as AFC (Agile- Focus-Convergence) and ""small data, big data, small intelligence"". The synergy of parallel system framework and artificial intelligence technology is also discussed and investigated, leading to the origin and implications of ""parallel intelligence"". A campus-wide energy management problem with considerations of human factors is utilized as an illustrative example of applying the parallel system mathematical representation and computational framework in power and energy systems.

Considering the assets, the twin is meant to be able to both exhibit the actual and current states of the resources, and provide some estimates about the future behaviour of these resources. To target the sustainability pillar of future industrial systems, the energy monitoring and management are critical issues. Consequently, the integration of multi-physics models helping to model the resources inside the twin is a major issue to deal with. This article introduces a framework integrating the models inside the twin of the ARTI architecture, proposes a methodology to implement the twin on a resource and illustrates these ideas in a case study on injection moulding machines. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",ARTI; Digital Twin; Discrete-event simulation; Energy management; Energy monitoring; Intelligent being; Multi-physics simulation,,,,,,,,,"Stock, T., Seliger, G., Opportunities of sustainable manufacturing in industry 4.0 (2016) Procedia CIRP, 40, pp. 536-541; Giret, A., Trentesaux, D., Prabhu, V., Sustainability in manufacturing operations scheduling: A state of the art review (2015) J.

The microgrid research field is also evolving to enable intelligent operation of energy management through digitalization. Problems occur when operating the actual microgrid, causing issues such as difficulty in decision making and system abnormalities. Using digital twin technology, which is one of the technologies representing the fourth industrial revolution, it is possible to overcome these problems by changing the microgrid configuration and operating algorithms of virtual space in various ways and testing them in real time. In this study, we proposed an energy storage system (ESS) operation scheduling model to be applied to virtual space when constructing a microgrid using digital twin technology. An ESS optimal charging/discharging scheduling was established to minimize electricity bills and was implemented using supervised learning techniques such as the decision tree, NARX, and MARS models instead of existing optimization techniques. NARX and decision trees are machine learning techniques. MARS is a nonparametric regression model, and its application has been increasing. Its performance was analyzed by deriving performance evaluation indicators for each model. Using the proposed model, it was found in a case study that the amount of electricity bill savings when operating the ESS is greater than that incurred in the actual ESS operation. The suitability of the model was evaluated by a comparative analysis with the optimization-based ESS charging/discharging scheduling pattern. © 2020 by the authors.",Digital twin; Energy storage system; Machine learning; Microgrid; Optimal scheduling,Decision making; Decision trees; Digital storage; Digital twin; Electric energy storage; Microgrids; Regression analysis; Scheduling; Supervised learning; Energy storage systems; Evaluation indicators; Industrial revolutions; Information and Communication Technologies; Intelligent operations; Machine learning techniques; Non-parametric regression; Optimization techniques; Learning systems,,,,,"20A01110; Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, KERI; National Research Council of Science and Technology, NST","Funding: This research was supported by the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI) primary research program through the National Research Council of Science and Technology (NST) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea (No. 20A01110).","Acknowledgments: This research was supported by the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI) primary research program through the National Research Council of Science and Technology (NST) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea (No. 20A01110).","www.energy.or.kr, Korea Energy Agency.

A promising approach, which has been discovered recently as key technology by several industries is the Digital Twin (DT) concept. A DT connects the virtual representation of a physical object, system or process by available information and sensor data streams, which allows to gather new information about the system it mirrors by applying analytic functions. Thereby the DT technology can help to fill sensor data gaps, e. g., to support anomaly detection, and to predict future operating conditions and system states. This paper discusses a dynamic power system DT as a cornerstone instance of a new generation of EMS, and a prospective new EMS architecture, to support the increasingly complex operation of electric power systems. Unlike in traditional offline power system models, the parameters are updated dynamically using measurement information from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and a wide area monitoring system (WAMS) to tune the model. This allows to derive a highly accurate virtual representation of the mirrored physical objects. A simulation engine, the Digital Dynamic Mirror (DDM) is introduced, in order to be able to reproduce the state of a reference network in real-time. The validation of the approach is carried out by a case study. In a closed loop within EMS applications, the DDM can help to assess contingency mitigation strategies, thus it can support the decision-making process under variable system conditions. The next generation of control centre Energy Management System (EMS) can benefit from this development by augmentation of the dynamic observability, and the rise of operator situation awareness. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.",assistant system; control centre; cyber-physical system; decision support; Digital Twin; EMS; situation awareness,,,,,,,,,"Handschin, E., Petroianu, A., (1991) Energy management systems: Operation and control of electric energy transmission systems, , Berlin Springer; Liu, Y., Wu, L., Li, J., D-PMU based applications for emerging active distribution systems: A review (2020) Electric Power Systems Research, 179; Prostejovsky, A.M., Bindner, H.W., Kosek, A.M., Kok, K., (2017) Increased Observability in Electric Distribution Grids: Emerging Applications Promoting the Active Role of Distribution System Operators, , PhD Dissertation Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark; Biagini, V., Subasic, M., Oudalov, A., Kreusel, J., The autonomous grid: Automation, intelligence and the future of power systems (2020) Energy Research & Social Science, 65; Badrzadeh, B., Emin, Z., Hillberg, E., Jacobson, D., Kocewiak, L., Lietz, G., Da Silva, F.F., Val Escudero, M., (2020) CIGRE Science & Engineering (CSE), 17, pp. 30-46. , The Need for Enhanced Power System Modelling Techniques and Simulation Tools; Brosinsky, C., Westermann, D., Krebs, R., (2018) 2018 IEEE International Energy Conference (ENERGYCON), pp. 1-6. , Recent and prospective developments in power system control centers: Adapting the digital twin technology for application in power system control centers Limassol, Cyprus; Zhao, J., Gomez-Exposito, A., Netto, M., Mili, L., Abur, A., Terzija, V., Kamwa, I., Meliopoulos, A.P.S., Power System Dynamic State Estimation: Motivations, Definitions, Methodologies, and Future Work (2019) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 34 (4), pp. 3188-3198; Sass, F., Sennewald, T., Westermann, D., Automated Corrective Actions by VSC-HVDC-systems: A novel Remedial Action Scheme (2019) IEEE Trans.

As it involves the scheduling and management of massive simulation computing tasks, how to assign simulation computing tasks to computing servers in a balanced manner and minimize the completion time of all tasks are the key to scheduling. Analyzed and discussed the existing problems of task scheduling algorithms, based on this, combined with the characteristics of simulation computing tasks, this paper proposes a dynamic scheduling management method for multi-energy system digital twin simulation computing tasks. Taking into account the characteristics of stable computing completion time for simulation computing tasks, a comprehensive priority index is designed to quantify the execution sequence of simulation computing tasks, then based on this comprehensive priority index, a task assignment mechanism as the goal of minimizing computing completion time of application is proposed.

However, several challenges including excessively long waiting time and a serious waste of energy still exist on the shop-floor where limited buffer exists for each machine (e.g., shop-floor that manufactures large-size products). The production logistics tasks are released after work-in-processes (WIPs) are processed, and the machines will be occupied before trolleys arrival when using passive material handling strategy. To address this issue, a proactive material handling method for CPS enabled shop-floor (CPS-PMH) is proposed. Firstly, the manufacturing resources (machines and trolleys) are made smart by applying CPS technologies so that they are able to sense, act, interact and behave within a smart environment. Secondly, a shop-floor digital twin model is created, aiming to reflect their status just like real-life objects, and key production performance indicators can be analysed timely. Then, a time-weighted multiple linear regression method (TWMLR) is proposed to forecast the remaining processing time of WIPs. A proactive material handling model is designed to allocate smart trolleys optimally. Finally, a case study from Southern China is used to validate the proposed method and results show that the proposed CPS-PMH can largely reduce the total non-value-added energy consumption of manufacturing resources and optimize the routes of smart trolleys. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Cyber physical system (CPS); Large-size product; Material handling; Prediction model; Remaining processing time; Shop-floor,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Floors; Linear regression; Manufacture; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Large-size product; Material handling; Prediction model; Processing time; Shop floor; Materials handling,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51675441; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program): 2018YFB1703402; Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project: B13044","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial supports of National Science Foundation of China (51675441), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFB1703402), and the 111 Project Grant (B13044).",,"Wang, S., Wan, J., Zhang, D., Li, D., Zhang, C., Towards smart factory for industry 4.0: a self-organized multi-agent system with big data based feedback and coordination (2016) Comput.

The new generation of machine tools should be digitalized, highly efficient, network-accessible and intelligent. An intelligent machine tool (IMT) driven by the digital twin provides a superior solution for the development of intelligent manufacturing. In this paper, a real-time machining data application and service based on IMT digital twin is presented. Multisensor fusion technology is adopted for real-time data acquisition and processing. Data transmission and storage are completed using the MTConnect protocol and components. Multiple forms of HMIs and applications are developed for data visualization and analysis in digital twin, including the machining trajectory, machining status and energy consumption. An IMT digital twin model is established with the aim of further data analysis and optimization, such as the machine tool dynamics, contour error estimation and compensation. Examples of the IMT digital twin application are presented to prove that the development method of the IMT digital twin is effective and feasible. The perspective development of machining data analysis and service is also discussed. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Data fusion; Data service; Digital twin; Intelligent machine tool; Machining data,Data acquisition; Data fusion; Data visualization; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Error compensation; Information analysis; Machine tools; Manufacture; Data services; Digital twin; Estimation and compensation; Intelligent machine; Intelligent Manufacturing; Machining data; Real-time data acquisition and processing; Visualization and analysis; Data handling,,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2016YFB1102503",The authors would like to present considerable gratitude for the financial support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFB1102503).

A vehicle simulation model of pure battery electric vehicles equipped with single pedal control system is established and calibrated by the experimental data based on vehicle energy flow and driving range analysis, the simulation doesn't include thermal aspect of the battery/vehicle. Next, the effects of different environmental and control parameters on energy consumption and driving range of pure electric vehicles are analyzed. The main findings are: (1) for the single driving cycle, the relative error of battery power and current is below 5%, and the absolute error of battery voltage is below 2.5 V. For the whole driving range, the absolute error of driving range is only about 5.75 km. (2) The main factors influencing energy consumption and driving range are average vehicle speed, running time and the frequency distribution of braking process, besides, the energy consumption of congested traffic with/without regenerative brake control system are 46.07 kW·h/100 km and 47.19 kW·h/100 km, respectively, meanwhile, vehicle with regenerative braking saves 2.43% energy under congested traffic. (3) The threshold of quitting the working condition of energy recovery for the motor can be set in a certain value based on the safety of driver in the emergencies and energy conversion. Further, the model and data in the paper can be applied to evaluate and optimize the energy consumption and driving range by changing different technologies or strategies in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Driving range; Electric vehicles; Energy consumption simulation model using digital twins; Performance prediction; Road traffic; Single pedal control system,Battery electric vehicles; Control systems; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Errors; Regenerative braking; Traffic congestion; Brake control system; Congested traffic; Control parameters; Frequency distributions; Performance characteristics; Pure electric vehicles; Vehicle energy consumption; Vehicle simulation; Secondary batteries; control system; electric vehicle; energy flow; equipment; performance assessment; simulation,,,,,"2017QNRC001; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51776061; Hunan University, HNU","This research paper is jointly sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 51776061 ), and the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program of China Association for Science and Technology (No. 2017QNRC001 ).

The research is relevant from the point of view of safety and energy saving of mining operations, since the process of ventilation of underground mining companies consumes from 30 to 50% of all company electricity. Existing methods of ventilation control often do not ensure rational energy consumption, as they do not take into account the dynamics of air distribution and changes in environmental parameters. The proposed method includes basic algorithms for calculating the interrelationship of physical parameters of general natural draught between the trunks. The method includes: calculation of the draught's power; calculation of productivity and the choice of the required mode of operation for the main fan unit (MFU) considering the inertia of the ventilation system; dynamic calculation of the control signal on the fan unit taking into account the impact of the general natural draught. The method is focused on the implementation of the TICK stack used to create IoT applications as part of the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) for ventilation based on the InfluxData platform. The proposed CPS architecture consists of four subsystems: physical object subsystem, IoT network and computing infrastructure - ICT infrastructure, digital twin, user interface. CPS architecture provides processing of data from energy meters, controllers and air environment parameters, implemented in on-line and off-line calculation units. © 2020 IEEE.",Cyber-Physical System; Digital Twin; InfluxData Platform; Information System Architecture; Internet of Things; Modelica,Data handling; Digital twin; Dynamics; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Manufacture; Memory architecture; Network architecture; User interfaces; Ventilation; Computing infrastructures; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Dynamic calculations; Environmental parameter; ICT infrastructures; Physical parameters; Ventilation control; Ventilation systems; Internet of things,,,,,,,,"Krainov, A.V., Pashkov, E.N., Ponomaryov, A.V., Conjugate heat transfer in the interaction of the viscous liquid with technological elements of energy systems in conditions of their internal contour moving (2014) Advanced Materials Research, 1040, pp. 876-880; Gendler, S.G., The justification of new technique ventilation at contraction of working with two exits in soil surface (2016) Eurasian Mining, (2), pp. 41-44; Aitao, Z., Wang, K., Role of gas ventilation pressure on the stability of airway airflow in underground ventilation (2018) Journal of Mining Science, 54 (1), pp. 111-119; Xu, B., Analysis and design of real-time micro-environment parameter monitoring system based on internet of things (2016) IEEE Int.

Relying on massive quantity of sensors, digital twin technology makes it possible to monitor the condition of an energy network in real time. However, for decision makers, future condition is more valuable. Common types of energy like cooling, heating and electrical power, are difficult to be stored. So, the production and consumption of energy shall be in a balance. The prediction of energy consumption helps to reduce cost and waste. Furthermore, the prediction equipment condition can support scheduling and maintenance. As a result, accurate and efficient condition prediction is strongly required in novel energy network. To solve the problem, a principle components analysis (PCA) based temporal and spatial view analysis and prediction (PTSVP) model is proposed in this paper. Because of the considerable amount of data in energy network, data analysis is difficult and inefficient. Dimension reduction can help to reduce data model complexity and lead to efficient prediction. Thanks to the linear dependency among network record, we use feature exaction technology to reduce dimension of energy network data. Besides, traditional prediction model tends to ignore the spatial relations among data. In this paper, both temporal and spatial factors are considered to make this prediction model more accurate and explainable. We apply this model to a practical energy network in Hongqiao, Shanghai, and compare it with traditional statistical learning and machine learning models. The result shows that our model is accurate, stable and efficient. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Dimension reduction; Energy network; Internet of things; Temporal and spatial modeling,Decision making; Digital twin; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Spatial variables measurement; Efficient predictions; Equipment conditions; Intelligent energies; Machine learning models; Principle components analysis; Production and consumption; Statistical learning; Temporal and spatial; Data reduction,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61972243",Acknowledgement.

In practice, DSM is utilized to change the pattern of electrical energy consumed by end-users to modify the load profile by manipulating the price of the electricity. This study focuses on the energy consumption consumed by students who are paying electricity bills indirectly. Therefore, the effectiveness of conventional DSM methods on this user requires further investigation. In this study, the FIS estimates the synthetic load profile based on the student's behavior profile. Then, three DSM techniques: load clipping, load shifting, and load conservation, are applied to the electrical usage behavior model. The FIS estimates the synthetic load profile based on the modified electrical usage behavior model with these DSM techniques. From this estimation, the synthetic load profiles are analyzed and compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the DSM methods on the students. The result shows that the FIS estimates the synthetic load profile satisfactorily. Also, load conservation is the most effective technique in reducing the peak load profile and power consumption for this type of user. Conclusively, the result implies that the proposed methodology can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the DSM method to reshape the load profile. © TÜBİTAK",Demand side management; Digital twin; Fuzzy inference system; Smart grid; Synthetic load profile,Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Students; Behavior model; Electrical energy; Electricity bill; Fuzzy inference systems; Load profiles; Load shifting; Peak load; Student behavior; Demand side management,,,,,"Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, KPM: H405; Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, UTHM","The authors would like to thank Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), Johor and Ministry of Education (MOE), Malaysia for the award of the grant that enabled this research under the grant No. H405.",,"Brosinsky, C, Song, X, Westermann, D., Digital twin concept of a continuously adaptive power system mirror (2019) International ETG-Congress 2019, ETG Symposium, pp. 1-20. , New York, NY, USA; Gaur, G, Mehta, N, Khanna, R, Kaur, S., Demand side management in a smart grid environment (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid and Smart Cities, pp. 227-231. , Singapore; Anjana, SP., Intelligent demand side management for residential users in a smart micro-grid (2017) 2017 International Conference on Technological Advancements in Power and Energy, pp. 1-5. , Kollam, India; Ma, K, Yao, T, Yang, J, Guan, X., Electrical power and energy systems residential power scheduling for demand response in smart grid (2016) International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy System, 78, pp. 320-325; (2008) Efficient Management of Electrical Energy Regulations 2008, , Energy Commission of Malaysia.

This paper presents the design methodology, mathematical analysis, simulation study, and experimental validation of a digital twin approach for fault diagnosis. We develop a digital twin that estimates the measurable characteristic outputs of a PV energy conversion unit (PVECU) in real time. The PVECU constitutes a PV source and a source-level power converter. The fault diagnosis is performed by generating and evaluating an error residual vector, which is the difference between the estimated and measured outputs. A PV panel-level power converter prototype is built to demonstrate how the sensing, processing, and actuation capabilities of the converter can enable effective fault diagnosis in real time. The experimental results show detection and identification of ten different faults in the PVECU. The time to fault detection (FD) in the power converter and the electrical sensors is less than 290 μs and the identification time is less than 4 ms. The time to FD and identification in the PV panel are less than 80 ms and 1.2 s, respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates higher fault sensitivity than that of existing approaches. It can diagnose a 20% drift in the electrical sensor gains and a 20% shading of a solar cell in the PV panel. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Converters; estimation; fault diagnosis; fault location; solar power generation,Electric fault location; Estimation; Failure analysis; Finite difference method; Photovoltaic cells; Power converters; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Torque converters; Actuation capability; Building applications; Building integrated; Design Methodology; Detection and identifications; Experimental validations; Mathematical analysis; Photovoltaic systems; Fault detection,,,,,"National Sleep Foundation, NSF","Manuscript received October 26, 2018; revised February 6, 2019; accepted March 31, 2019.

Multiple small-scale tests performed, and a lot of supercritical CO cycle aspects studied. Currently, 3-10 MW-scale test facilities are being built. However, there are still several pieces of SCO2 technology with the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3-5 and system modeling is one of them. The system modeling approach shall be sufficiently accurate and flexible, to be able to precisely predict the off-design and part-load operation of the cycle at both supercritical and condensing modes with diverse control strategies. System modeling itself implies the utilization of component models which are often idealized and may not provide a sufficient level of fidelity. Especially for prediction of off-design and part load supercritical CO2 cycle performance with near-critical compressor and transition to condensing modes with lower ambient temperatures, and other aspects of cycle operation under alternating grid demands and ambient conditions. In this study, the concept of a digital twin to predict off-design supercritical CO2 cycle performance is utilized. In particular, with the intent to have sufficient cycle simulation accuracy and flexibility the cycle simulation system with physics-based methods/modules were created for the bottoming 15.5 MW Power Generation Unit (PGU). The heat source for PGU is GE LM6000-PH DLE gas turbine. The PGU is a composite (merged) supercritical CO2 cycle with a high heat recovery rate, its design and the overall scheme are described in detail. The calculation methods utilized at cycle level and components' level, including loss models with an indication of prediction accuracy, are described. The flowchart of the process of off-design performance estimation and data transfer between the modules as well. The comparison of the results obtained utilizing PGU digital twin with other simplified approaches is performed. The results of the developed digital twin utilization to optimize cycle control strategies and parameters to improve off-design cycle performance are discussed in detail.

As a reaction to changing market demands and environmental challenges, maritime systems are becoming more complex and coupled. Digital approaches such as digital twins and co-simulation are coping these challenges and offer new opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vessel. In this work, we present the digital twin modelling and the co-simulation of a typical AC ship power and propulsion system including the power stage, relevant local controllers and a high-level controller. The power and control components are modelled individually and exported as Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs). To perform a co-simulation of the ship electric power system, the Open Simulation Platform (OSP) is utilized. This co-simulation environment connects the individual FMUs and routes the data between the sub-simulators of the digital twin. A typical test scenario is carried out to demonstrate the correct functioning of the ship power and propulsion system as well as the OSP environment. © 2020 IEEE.",Co-Simulation; Digital Ship; Digital Twin Modelling; Open Simulation Platform (OSP); Ship Power System,Electric power systems; Industrial electronics; Life cycle; Marine power plants; Ship propulsion; Ships; Simulation platform; Control components; Environmental challenges; High level controllers; Local controllers; Maritime industry; Modelling and simulation technologies; Propulsion system; Ship electric power systems; Digital twin,,,,,,"The Functional Mock-up Interface [13] is a tool independent standard for the exchange of dynamic models and co-simulation.

Digital twinning of systems can be utilized for anomaly detection, diagnosis and the estimation of the system's remaining useful life in order to optimize operations and maintenance processes in a nuclear plant. In this regard, a conceptual framework for the application of digital twin technology for the prognosis of Control Element Drive Mechanism (CEDM), and a data-driven approach to anomaly detection using coil current profile are presented in this study. Health management of plant components can capitalize on the data and signals that are already recorded as part of the monitored parameters of the plant's instrumentation and control systems. This work is focused on the development of machine learning algorithm and workflow for the analysis of the CEDM using the recorded coil current data. The workflow involves features extraction from the coil-current profile and consequently performing both clustering and classification algorithms. This approach provides an opportunity for health monitoring in support of condition-based predictive maintenance optimization and in the development of the CEDM digital twin model for improved plant safety and availability. © 2020",Digital twin; Machine learning; Nuclear power plant; PHM,,,,,,,,,"Industry Guideline for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants (2011), no.

It brings challenges including reduced efficiency, increased costs and safety issues in power plants. At a component level, load changes of thermal power plants are mainly carried out through actions of control stage systems of steam turbines. Accurate performance monitoring of control stage systems is key to enable faster and more flexible operation of thermal power plants thus provides opportunities to accommodate more renewable power with limited penalty to efficiency and safety. In this paper, a hybrid modelling method based on operation data and first-principle mechanism is proposed for performance monitoring of control stage systems. The hybrid modelling method features a) flow rate calculation of high-pressure control valves with limited measurement data, and b) flow and efficiency characteristics calculation over full working ranges of control stages. The proposed hybrid modelling method is validated via two case studies of a 330 MW subcritical steam turbine and a 1000 MW ultra-supercritical steam turbine, where digital twins of control stages are developed. Results show that average relative errors between simulated and measured values of exit pressure and exit temperature of control stages are within a range of one percent, providing great potential for plant-wide digital twin development and online performance monitoring. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Control stage;

These include controlled multi-agent cooperation (such as smart grids) and identification of mathematical models connecting different key performance indicators. The authors of this paper claim that system architecture based on intelligent agents’ concept outperforms ad-hoc implementations of distributed systems and architectures. The main advantages of a multi-agent system are the presence of a decision making layer, theory-based fault tolerance and scalability. Advanced distributed coordination and decision-making techniques allow more effective operation and availability. The internal general computational framework presented in the paper can be used for solving business tasks (for example, the task of routine optimization as a part of underlying multi-agent framework). The aforementioned system has been applied to solve a problem of power grid member communication.

The challenge with these emerging ecosystems is that their effective integration and management are becoming increasingly complex. The Collaborative Virtual Power Plant Ecosystem (CVPP-E) concept was proposed as a contribution to their effective management using a collaborative approach. Here, the CVPP manager promotes collaborative behaviour such as collaborative consumption by influencing the consumption behaviour of members through incentives. The objective is to influence community members to “delegate” their “deferrable loads” for effective management by the manager. In this work, a framework for modelling and simulation of incentivization and related behavioural intervention, adapting the CVPP-E as a digital twin model of a REC is described. The architectural structure, context of incentivization, behavioural change techniques, modelling methodology and expected outcomes of the model are outlined. Some key definitions for the model and future works are also introduced. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2020.",Behavioural change; Collaborative Networks; Collaborative Virtual Power Plants; Demand Response; Incentives,Digital twin; Energy resources; Managers; Power plants; Architectural structure; Collaborative approach; Distributed Energy Resources; Effective management; Modelling and simulations; Modelling methodology; Renewable energy community; Virtual power plants; Ecosystems,,,,,"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT: UID/EEA/00066/2019, UIDB/00066/2020; Fundació Catalana de Trasplantament, FCT","Acknowledgement.

Manufacturing has advanced from steam power to electric power, to computing controls, and now to the fourth industrial revolution of digitization of industrial processes and increased connectivity, delivering unprecedented optimization capabilities. This Industrial Internet of Things (MoT, also called Industry 4.0) is beginning to shape the way aluminum processors are designed and operated, introducing new ways of working, with increased data access for all levels of personnel, from maintenance to management. Smart systems, incorporating sensors and wireless communication, together with internet-enabled data storage and processing technology (commonly referred to as the Cloud) are making more and more data available, which brings about new challenges in analyzing and managing large data sets. In-depth process knowledge is key to filtering through the data to identify key performance in-dicators ana interpret trends and associations correctly, leading to the creation of computer models of the aluminum processing equipment (or digital twins). The growth of self-learning computer programs (i.e., machine learning and artificial intelligence), along with the increased computing power that tne Cloud brings, has led to capabilities that can be used to streamline data analysis and improve the understanding of relationships between key parameters in aluminum manufacturing processes. This paper reviews aluminum industry practices and looks at the current state-of-the-art in Industry 4.0, focusing on key concepts and how they can be applied to the aluminum industry. © 2020 Fellom Publishing Company.

EDF has initiated R&D in this field for more than 10 years and some tools are now commonly used by EDF operators. They cover outage management (use of virtual reality for outage preparation, 3D visualization of plant maintenance and upgrade…), human performance in operation (plant field workers mobile technologies, augmented reality to improve situation awareness, advanced training…), advanced plant control automation and digital architecture (fab lab for design and fast checking of future concept of operation…), as well as on-line equipment and process monitoring. Now the new challenges are to develop “digital twins” which are digital models fed by on-line data from operation and to benefit from data analytics science which made great progress during the last years. EDF has engaged new programs in these fields that will support long term operation of most critical nuclear equipment. A first development, dedicated to a 1:3 scale mock-up of a NPP containment is now operational. It gives an idea of the technical challenges to handle before deploying such technology for EDF fleet. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,,,,"Baraldi, P., Di Maio, F., Rigamonti, M., Zio, E., Seraoui, R., Unsupervised clustering of vibration signals for identifying anomalous conditions in a nuclear turbine (2015) J.

A control stage is a key component for pressure and flow control in steam turbines of power plants. Its modelling and simulation for digital twins are important measures for steam turbine operation diagnosis and optimization. However, sequential operation modes of valves in a control stage result in dramatic changes in thermal and mechanical behaviours of the control stage, and modelling the change in behaviours still remains a challenge due to lack of measurements. In this paper, a hybrid modelling method based on the first-principle mechanism and actual operation data is proposed. Inlet flow of a control stage are obtained by calculating flow coefficient at the full range of sequential operation of valves. Then, characteristic functions of a control stage are obtained using the first-principle mechanism. In order to verify the reliability of the proposed method, a control stage of an ultra-supercritical steam turbine with typical sequential valves operation mode is modelled and simulated. Results show that the average value of the simulation relative error is less than 1%, which proves that the method has high simulation accuracy and reliability and lays a foundation for application of digital twins in smart power plants. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Control stage; Digital twins; First-principle mechanism; Sequential valve,,,,,,"BP; Tsinghua University, THU; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2018YFB0604301",The authors gratefully acknowledge the support by The National Key Research and Development of China (2018YFB0604301) and the Phase III Collaboration between BP and Tsinghua University.,,"Tao, F., Qi, Q.L., Wang, L.H., Nee, A.Y.C., Digital Twins and Cyber-Physical Systems toward Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: Correlation and Comparison (2019) Engineering, 5 (4), pp. 653-661; Hua, Z.G., Guo, R., Cui, X., Wang, Y., Discussion and Study on Technical Route of Smart Thermal Power Plant (2019) Thermal Power Generation, 10, pp. 8-14; Li, D.C., Wang, J.H., Study of supercritical power plant integration with high temperature thermal energy storage for flexible operation (2018) Journal of Energy Storage, 20, pp. 140-152; Yu, J.X., Liu, P., Liu, S.J., Li, Z., Modeling of Variable Conditions of Steam Turbine Control Stage Based on Operation Data (2019) Journal of Chinese Society of Power Engineering, 39 (7), pp. 541-547; Zhong, X.B., The Research of High Precision Model Used for On-line Monitoring of Thermal System of Thermal Power Units (2014) Thesis, , Tsinghua University Beijing, China; Zhu, H.L., The Research of Modeling, Monitoring and Optimizing for Thermal System of Thermal Power Plant Based on Ebsilon (2015) Thesis, , Tsinghua University Beijing, China; Zheng, Y., Operation Optimization of In-service Thermal Power Plants Based on Big Data Modeling (2018) Thesis, , Tsinghua University Beijing, China; Xiao, Z.H., Sheng, W., Xia, Y., Turbine Equipment and System (2008), pp. 13-15. , China Electric Power Press (in Chinese); Wang, Y.D., Zheng, Z.J., Experimental and Numerical Research on Influence of Spool Stroke on Flow Characteristics of Angle Seat Valve (2018) Chinese Hydraulics and Pneumatics, 327 (11), pp. 46-51; Cao, Z.Q., Turbine Variable Working Condition Characteristics (1991) Water Power Press, pp. 36-38. , (in Chinese)",,,,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,15707946,,,,,,,,,,

From the base load operation era we are moving into a flexible and dynamic engine operation of gas turbines. In particular, aero derivative engines that have the capacity to start up, shut down in a short time frame are becoming quite popular for both hybrid power plant arrangements and distributed electricity generation. Advances in computational intelligence, such as digital twins, have amplified the importance of condition monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics capabilities in the face of gas turbine operation. Given the dynamic operating profile of the gas turbines, it is of paramount importance to develop, tune and deploy engine models that are accurate and robust to accommodate their nonlinear behavior. Performing diagnostics in transient conditions has recently gained attention, since the gas turbines are acting as partners of renewables and they have a supporting role. Among a family of diagnostics methods, one that has real time capabilities is based on zero-dimensional engine models. This paper present a novel diagnostic approach for determining the health of a gas turbine when it works in conjunction with a wind farm in hybrid power plant. In contrary to our earlier works, where we have mathematically modeled component maps to derive the health of an engine, in this paper we propose a model-based diagnostic method without reconstructing component maps according to their degradation. Once the engine model is initially adapted to its clean condition, it is subsequently tuned in real time to reflect the changes in both the operation and degradation with respect to a benchmark engine model. Time evolving multiple component degradation scenarios for a gas turbine operating in conjunction with a wind farm, are simulated to test the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. From a bank of simulated measurements, data trending is performed which facilitates the detection of degradation and provides useful conclusions about the health state of the engine. This diagnostic method is suitable for gas turbines that spend most of their life time in part-load and transient operation and it forms a simple and useful tool for operators in planning their assets maintenance in a computational efficient and accurate manner..

Not only plant performance and utility profit are dependent on accurate plant operational parameters but, more importantly, set safety limits need to be met in order to ensure safe operation of nuclear power plants in particular. Using non-quality-assured process data for operational decisions can result in significant over- or under-power of the plant. In addition, all new technologies such as AI, IIoT, digital twin technology, etc. rely on robust process data as input, putting at risk the significance of the results from the continuing data processing (“garbage in, garbage out”). One method, certified process data reconciliation, or CPDR, cuts through the vast amount of available process data and generates all relevant process values with the smallest uncertainty possible. 95% of all collected process data can be discarded after introduction of CPDR. With CPDR, plant operation and maintenance can be significantly optimized and utilities can profit by realizing e.g. power recovery and measurement uncertainty recapture (MUR). Because the focus on reconciled instead of measured values constitutes a paradigm shift, the application of CPDR needs to be communicated to Nuclear Regulators.

When used with a taut mooring, the anchor is typically subjected to a maintained load component and intermittent episodes of cyclic loading throughout the design life. These loads, and the associated shearing, remoulding and consolidation processes, cause changes in the anchor capacity, particularly in soft, fine-grained soils. The changing anchor capacity affects the mooring performance by changing the safety margin and also the overall system reliability. In this paper the changing anchor capacity in reconstituted, normally consolidated natural carbonate silt was assessed through a series of beam centrifuge tests on horizontally loaded circular plate anchors. The results demonstrate that full consolidation under a typical maintained load leads to a 50% gain in the anchor capacity, and subsequent cyclic loading and reconsolidation can triple this increase. An effective stress framework based on critical state concepts is employed to explain and support the experimental observations. This study shows that, when viewed from a whole-life reliability perspective, maintained and cyclic loading provide a long-term enhancement of anchor capacity in soft, fine-grained soils. This beneficial effect is currently overlooked in design practice, but can be predicted using the framework shown here, which can form the basis for a digital twin that monitors the through-life integrity of a plate anchor. © 2019",anchors & anchorages; bearing capacity; centrifuge modelling; consolidation; numerical modelling; offshore engineering; soil/structure interaction,Bearing capacity; Consolidation; Critical current density (superconductivity); Cyclic loads; Digital twin; Energy policy; Mooring; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Reliability; Beneficial effects; Consolidation process; Critical state concepts; Fine grained soil; Mooring performance; Offshore floating; Renewable energy projects; System reliability; Trenching; anchor; centrifugal model test; consolidation; cyclic loading; effective stress; mooring system; silt; soft soil,,,,,"Shell; Australian Research Council, ARC; University of Western Australia, UWA","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The first author acknowledges his research studentship support from the ARC Industrial Transformation Research Hub for Offshore Floating Facilities and the University of Western Australia.

In the domain of industrial energy systems, they are applied to facilitate a flexible and optimized operation. With the help of Digital Twins, the industry can participate even stronger in the ongoing renewable energy transition. Current Digital Twin implementations are often application-specific solutions without general architectural concepts and their structures and namings differ, although the basic concepts are quite similar. For this reason, we analyzed concepts, architectures, and frameworks for Digital Twins in the literature to develop a technology-independent Generic Digital Twin Architecture (GDTA), which is aligned with the information technology layers of the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0). This alignment facilitates a common naming and understanding of the proposed architectural structure. A proof-of-concept shows the application of Semantic Web technologies for instantiating the proposed GDTA for a use case of a Packed-Bed Thermal Energy Storage (PBTES). © 2020 by the authors.

A numerical model of an onshore wind turbine was created with FAST software developed by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The structural and mechanical properties of the structure were calculated from the geometric properties of the tower and blades. The aerodynamic properties of different sections of the blades were computed with 2D models created with ANSYS Fluent. Having the wind turbine fully characterised, the control mechanisms were calibrated using data from the manufacturer catalogues. Numerous time series of wind excitation for different operation conditions were generated, and the structural response computed. Additionally, the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) operating in parallel with a series of extensometers and accelerometers located in strategic points along a real wind turbine tower and blades provided a full description of the internal forces in both locations and the estimation of the modal properties for different operating conditions. Both measured and simulated response allowed the identification and validation of structural dynamic properties and static and dynamic internal loads. In spite of several approximations and simplifications, the results obtained with the numerical model were in good agreement with the ones measured in the field. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Data acquisition; Digital twin; Dynamics; Numerical models; Structural dynamics; Structural properties; Torque; Turbomachine blades; Wind turbines; Accumulated fatigue damage; Aerodynamic properties; Different operating conditions; Floating wind turbines; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Structural and mechanical properties; Structural dynamic properties; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Onshore wind farms,,,,,PTDC/ECI-EST/29558/2017,"The support of EDP Renewables and VESTAS in greatly acknowledged.

This work presents a technique that uses readily available measurements to estimate signals that would otherwise require additional instrumentation. This study presents a digital twin concept with a focus on estimating wind speed, thrust, torque, tower-top position, and loads in the tower using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements. The model combines a linear state-space model obtained using OpenFAST linearizations, a wind speed estimator, and a Kalman filter algorithm that integrates measurements with the state model to perform state estimations. The measurements are: top acceleration, generator torque, pitch, and rotational speed. The article extends previous work that derived the linear state-space model using a different method. The new implementation, based on OpenFAST linearization capability, allows for a systematic extension of the method to more states, inputs, outputs, and to the offshore environment. Results from the two methods are compared, and the validation is made with additional measurements using the GE 1.5-MW turbine located at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory test site. Real-time damage equivalent loads of the tower bottom moment are estimated with an average accuracy of approximately 10%. Overall, the results from this proof of concept are encouraging, and further application of the model will be considered. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Data acquisition; Digital twin; Fatigue of materials; Linearization; Offshore oil well production; State space methods; Wind; Damage equivalent loads; Fatigue estimation; Kalman filter algorithms; Land based turbine; Linear state space model; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Offshore environments; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Torque,,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE: DE-AC36-08GO28308","This work was authored by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, operated by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

District cooling reduces the environmental impact and promotes the use of renewable sources. Earlier studies to optimise the production plants of district cooling systems were focused primarily on plants with compressor chillers and thermal energy storage devices. Although absorption chillers are crucial for integrating renewable sources into these systems, very few studies have considered them from the cooling perspective. In this regard, this paper presents the progress and results of the implementation of a virtual testbed based on a digital twin of a district cooling production plant with both compressor and absorption chillers. The aim of this study, carried out within the framework of INDIGO, a European Union-funded project, was (i) to develop a reliable model that can be used in a model predictive controller and (ii) to simulate the plant using this controller. The production plant components, which included absorption and compressor chillers, as well as cooling towers, were built using the equation-based Modelica programming language, and were calibrated using information from the manufacturer, together with real operation data. The remainder of the plant was modelled in Python. To integrate the Modelica models into the Python environment, a combination of machine learning techniques and state-space representation models was used. With these techniques, models with a high computational speed were obtained, which were suitable for real-time applications. These models were then used to build a model predictive control for the production plant to minimise the primary energy usage. The improvements in the control and the resultant energy savings achieved were compared with a baseline case working on a standard cascade control. Energy savings up to 50% were obtained in the simulation-based experiments. © 2020",District cooling; Machine learning; Modelica; Modelling; MPC; Testbed,Cascade control systems; Compressors; Controllers; Cooling systems; Digital storage; Digital twin; District heating; Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Heat storage; High level languages; Learning systems; Model predictive control; Refrigerators; State space methods; Testbeds; Thermoelectric equipment; Absorption chillers; Computational speed; District cooling system; Machine learning techniques; Model predictive controllers; Primary energy usages; Real-time application; State space representation; Absorption cooling,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 696098; Horizon 2020","The work leading to this research paper was out within the framework of the Project INDIGO, which had received funding from European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under grant agreement n° 696098 .","The work leading to this research paper was out within the framework of the Project INDIGO, which had received funding from European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under grant agreement n? 696098.","IEA, Global status report for buildings and construction 2019 (2019); Tracking buildings (2019), Paris; The future of cooling.

Electric vehicles are modern and promising alternative to conventional vehicles. They are characterized by lower operation cost and environment-friendly ability to use renewable sources of energy. Smart grids can be used in order to avoid undesirable impact of electric vehicles. Such grids require optimization and correct scheduling to handle growing number of electricity consumers. This can be achieved with implementation of specifically designed genetic algorithms. The goal of the paper is to select optimal method and propose it for using for optimization of the digital twin of the electric vehicles charging infrastructure. As a result of paper such method is proposed. Moreover, as a scientific novelty, genetic algorithm functions are compared and analyzed applying to the problem in consideration.

Among the most significant of those systems are industrial control systems (ICS) consisting of many cyber physical components, and smart grids are a prominent example of ICS, whose failures have potential to cause major disruptions in all aspects of our daily lives. In this paper, we provide an overview of smart grid cybersecurity standards, and review major threats to smart grid environments at the physical, network and application layers. In order to overcome the current lack of standards for security evaluation of smart grids, we propose a digital twins based approach for the complete life cycle of a smart grid, which accurately models the functioning of the physical grid and avoids service disruptions caused by running security tests on the actual grid. A digital twins based approach is promising to provide a common ground for the development of standardized models for continuous and comprehensive penetration testing of smart grids. © 2020 IEEE.",Cybersecurity; Digital Twins; IoT; Smart Grid,Digital twin; Electric power transmission networks; Industry 4.0; Network layers; Security of data; Smart power grids; Standardization; Computerized systems; Cybersecurity standards; Industrial control systems; Penetration testing; Security evaluation; Security vulnerabilities; Service disruptions; Standardized models; Internet of things,,,,,,,,"Baheti, R., Gill, H., Cyber-physical systems (2011) Tech.

By allowing users to feel each other's presence and physically manipulate objects from their interacted environments within 1 ms. The Tactile Internet facilitates fast multimodal interactions with multisensory information over the 5G network. 1 ms is a critical threshold in human perception of tactile response. For auditory response, this threshold is 100 ms and for visual response, it is 10 ms, which means delays above these thresholds are within the latency limit sensed by the human brain. In 4G, the round trip latency is 25 ms for an ideal environment. Clearly, that indicates 4G is not able to meet the requirements of tactile response. For this reason, the efforts to reduce latency in 5G are critical for Tactile Internet. Low-latency communications will also enable other digital twins' applications such as real-time control of smart grid, self-driving car, and so on. © 1994-2012 IEEE.",,Digital twin; Real time control; Auditory response; Critical threshold; Human perception; Low-latency communication; Multi-Modal Interactions; Multisensory information; Networked virtual environments; Visual response; 5G mobile communication systems,,,,,,,,"Saddik, A.E., Orozco, M., Eid, M., Cha, J., Haptics technologies: Bringing touch to multimedia (2011) Springer Series on Touch and Haptic Systems, , Berlin, Germany: Springer; Narumi, T., Kajinami, T., Nishizaka, S., Tanikawa, T., Hirose, M., Pseudogustatory, display system based on cross-modal integration of vision, olfaction and gustation (2011) Proc.

In this paper, the authors propose several requirements that a DT of a water distribution system should accomplish. Developing a DT is a challenge, and a continuous process of adjustments and learning is required. Due to the advantages of having a DT of the WDS always available, during the last years a strategy to build and maintain a DT of the water distribution network of Valencia (Spain) and its Metropolitan Area (1.6 million inhabitants) was developed. This is one of the first DTs built of a water utility, being currently in operation. The great benefits of their use in the daily operation of the system ensure that they will begin to be usual in the most advanced smart cities. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",detailed model; Digital Twin; Epanet; planning operation and maintenance; real time; Water Distribution Systems,distribution system; drinking water; metropolitan area; modeling; real time; smart city; water management; water planning; water supply; Comunidad Valencia; Spain; Valencia [Comunidad Valencia]; Valencia [Valencia (PRV)]; Valencia,,,,,,,,"Bartolín, H., Martínez, F., Cortés, J.A., Bringing up to Date WDS Models by Querying.

Their application for supporting real-time operational decisions has been also gaining increasing interest over the past decade. Accurate end-user nodal demands are critical to the reliability of hydraulic simulations for real-time decision support. Conventionally, nodal demands are set to a handful of periodically updated ensembles of demand patterns, which cannot represent the vast heterogeneity and volatility of demands. With advances in metering technology, consumption data with unprecedentedly high temporal and spatial resolutions are available to water utilities on a real-time basis. A framework is developed here to create a dynamic demand assignment hydraulic model, in which consumption data are assigned to nodes to update the water network model with the streaming data from the data center and without interruption of the hydraulic simulation run. The developed framework is cloud-based and scalable, making it suitable for water distribution systems of all sizes. The framework modifies the core EPANET engine to directly assign updated demands in order to overcome current software limitations. The model is applied and demonstrated using a real-world case study in the US. The results show the importance of the real-time demand assignment for the reliability of hydraulic models for making real-time operational decisions and the realization of digital twins of water infrastructure systems. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Data integration; Decision support systems; Digital twin; Hydraulic models; Smart meters; Water distribution systems; Water supply; Design and planning; Hydraulic simulation; Metering technology; Operational decisions; Real time decisions; Temporal and spatial; Water distribution system models; Water infrastructure; Real time systems; computer simulation; data set; decision making; hydrological modeling; real time; resource management; water demand; water management; United States,,,,,,,,"Alves, Z., Muranho, J., Albuquerque, T., Ferreira, A., Water distribution network's modeling and calibration: A case study based on scarce inventory data (2014) Procedia Eng., 70, pp. 31-40. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2014.02.005; Cocking, S., Business showcase: Sensus (2017) Irish Tech News, , September 7, 2017; Cominola, A., Giuliani, M., Castelletti, A., Rosenberg, D., Abdallah, A., Implications of data sampling resolution on water use simulation, end-use disaggregation, and demand management (2018) Environ.

Forecasting oil and gas production needs to capture the ranges of the multitude of uncertain parameters and their impact on the forecast to maximize the value of the project for the company. Several authors showed, however, that the oil and gas industry has challenges in adequately assessing the distributions of hydrocarbon production forecasts. The methods for forecasting hydrocarbon production developed with digitalization from using analytical solutions to numerical models with an increasing number of gridblocks (“digital twins”) toward ensembles of models covering the uncertainty of the various parameters. Analytical solutions and single numerical models allow calculation of incremental production for a single case. However, neither the uncertainty of the forecasts nor the question in which the distribution of various outcomes the single model is located can be determined. Ensemble-based forecasts are able to address these questions, but they need to be able to cover a large number of uncertain parameters and the amount of data that is generated accordingly. Theory-guided data science (TGDS) approaches have recently been used to overcome these challenges. Such approaches make use of the scientific knowledge captured in numerical models to generate a sufficiently large data set to apply data science approaches. These approaches can be combined with economics to determine the desirability of a project for a company (expected utility). Quantitative decision analysis, including a value of information (VoI) calculation, can be done addressing the uncertainty range but also the risk hurdles as required by the decision-maker (DM). The next step is the development of learning agent systems (agent: autonomous, goal-directed entity that observes and acts upon an environment) that are able to cope with the large amount of data generated by sensors and to use them for conditioning models to data and use the data in decision analysis. Companies need to address the challenges of data democratization to integrate and use the available data, organizational agility, and the development of data science skills but making sure that the technical skills, which are required for the TGDS approach, are kept.

In order to reduce and prevent failure of utility poles in extreme weather events, traditional inspection techniques have been used to understand a condition of utility poles. Because of (1) uncertain detection rate depending on inspectors' visual observation skills and (2) labor-intensive process to inspect large-scale poles, camera-equipped drones have been leveraged to capture image data for reducing human errors as well as inspection time and increasing the number of inspections. Despite the benefits, prior works mainly focused on accurate detection and classification of utility poles, rather than pole inspection and maintenance through visual analytics. This paper presents a novel method to stream vision-based pole inspection information (i.e., maximum leaning angle of poles) into a virtual environment toward digital twin modeling in the context of power distribution infrastructure systems. By leveraging a single 2D image per pole obtained from a drone, the maximum leaning angle of utility poles over large areas are estimated. The outcomes of vision-based utility pole analysis are then fed into a virtual environment. For evaluation, case studies were conducted on Bryan, TX. The resulting digital twin model representing the stability information of utility poles has the potential to be used as a basis for better designing disaster preparedness and hazard mitigation strategies regarding the preventive maintenance of power distribution networks. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Aircraft detection; Digital twin; Disaster prevention; Drones; Electric network analysis; Inspection; Disaster preparedness; Extreme weather events; Infrastructure systems; Inspection technique; Interdependent infrastructure systems; Labor intensive process; Power distribution network; Power distributions; Poles,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF",This material is in part based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation,,"Bandara, S., Rajeev, P., Gad, E., Sriskantharajah, B., Flatley, I., Damage detection of in service timber poles using hilbert-huang transform (2019) NDT and e International, 107, p. 102141. , Elsevier Ltd, (June); Baraneedaran, S., Gad, E., Flatley, I., Kamiran, A., (2009) Review of In-service Assessment of Timber Poles; Bizjak, T., Bollag, S., Kasler, D., (2018) Power Lines Keep Sparking Wildfires.

This paper reports the results of that study presenting new analysis that further verifies the utility and flexibility of the very general error correction measurement and post-processing technique in configurations that hitherto have not been considered. © 2020 IEEE.",Antenna; Computational Electromagnetic Simulation; Far-Field; MARS; Measurement; Multipath Suppression,Antennas; Computational electromagnetics; Digital twin; Error correction; Antenna measurement; Derived data; Far field; Mode filtering; Mode-based; Post-processing techniques; Reflection suppression; Electromagnetic simulation,,,,,,,,"Parini, C.G., Gregson, S.F., McCormick, J., Van, R.D.Janse, (2014) Theory and Practice of Modern Antenna Range Measurements, , IET Press; Gregson, S.F., Parini, C.G., Newell, A.C., A general and effective mode filtering method for the suppression of clutter in far-field antenna measurements (2018) Antenna Measurement Techniques Association Symposium, Williamsburg, , Washington, USA, November; Tian, Z., Gregson, S.F., Examination of the effectiveness of mode orthogonalization and filtering for scattering suppression in antenna measurements through computational electromagnetic simulation (2019) European Conference on Antennas and Propagation, , Krakow, Poland; Tian, Z., Gregson, S.F., Examination of spherical antenna far-field scattering suppression through electromagnetic simulation (2019) Antennas and Propagation Conference, , Birmingham, UK, November",,,IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society (APS);The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2020 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation and North American Radio Science Meeting, IEEECONF 2020",5 July 2020 through 10 July 2020,,167204,,9.78E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The UAV processes the received computation tasks from the mobile users (MUs) by creating the corresponding virtual machines. Due to finite shared I/O resource of the UAV in the MEC system, each MU competes to schedule local as well as remote task computations across the decision epochs, aiming to maximize the expected long-term computation performance. The non-cooperative interactions among the MUs are modeled as a stochastic game, in which the decision makings of a MU depend on the global state statistics and the task scheduling policies of all MUs are coupled. To approximate the Nash equilibrium solutions, we propose a proactive scheme based on the long short-term memory and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. A digital twin of the MEC system is established to train the proactive DRL scheme offline. Using the proposed scheme, each MU makes task scheduling decisions only with its own information. Numerical experiments show a significant performance gain from the scheme in terms of average utility per MU across the decision epochs. © 2020 IEEE.",deep reinforcement learning; digital twin.; long shortterm memory; Mobile-edge computing; resource awareness; unmanned aerial vehicle,Antennas; Decision making; Deep learning; Digital twin; Edge computing; Game theory; Multitasking; Reinforcement learning; Springs (components); Stochastic systems; Average utilities; Computation performance; Computation resources; Computation tasks; Computing system; Numerical experiments; Performance Gain; Resource awareness; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV),,,,,,,,"Mao, Y., A survey on mobile edge computing: The communication perspective (2017) IEEE Commun.

Models of the built environment at or above the ground surface need to be 3 dimensional to best fill that role, but the subsurface also has critical 3-dimensional properties that are even more difficult to characterize being hidden from view. There are many compelling use cases for high quality data on the underground environment at varying levels of detail, from which a list of 6 critical use cases are presented here. Data on the location and disposition of buried utility are difficult to collect and maintain, but the value of avoiding damage, delay, injury and cost with good underground data in all these cases far outstrips the cost and difficult of obtaining it. Effective management and utilization of underground data also depend on models and schemas to organize them. Sharing and exchange of such data require standard models that are agreed between data providers and consumers. There are presently a number of applicable models and standards, but they often reflect a specific perspective, focus, and priorities that make it difficult for any one of them to provide a holistic awareness of the entire underground built environment at the multiple levels of complexity required by the use cases. The draft Model for Underground Data Definition and Integration (MUDDI), a comprehensive integration model for underground information takes a modular approach, with a conceptual core that covers basic geometric representations of underground assets, and a number of extension modules that add more specialized capabilities as well as interfaces with existing models. Several prototyping efforts have generated physical implementations of the MUDDI conceptual model and application deployments populated by operational utilities data, in particular the NUAR and LUAR pilot projects sponsored by the UK Geospatial Commission. An Open Geospatial Consortium Standards Working Group (SWG) is being formed to build on the draft MUDDI model as well as the experiences gained in pilot projects, in order to publish a full specification of the model at the conceptual, logical, and physical levels. Another SWG objective will be to create a roadmap of critical extension modules, particularly those which support upcoming 3D-4D digital twin technologies for visualization, operation, and simulation. Other advanced use cases for these extensions, such as mixed reality visualization and navigation, are expected to become common as both the demands on our built environment and the data available to manage it continue to expand. © Authors 2020.",,Climate change; Climate models; Computer aided software engineering; Data visualization; Digital twin; Integration; Mixed reality; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Application deployment; Comprehensive integrations; Effective management; Geometric representation; Open geospatial consortium; Reality visualization; Underground environment; Underground infrastructure; Data integration,,,,,,,,"Lieberman, J., (2019) MUDDI Model for Underground Data Definition and Integration Engineering Report, , http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/17-090r1.html, ed; Portele, C., Vretanos, P., Heazel, C., (2019) OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core, , https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ogcapi-features; Gröger, G., Kolbe, T., Nagel, C., Häfele, K., (2019) OGC City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) Encoding Standard, , https://www.ogc.org/standards/citygml; (2017) OGC Geoscience Markup Language, , https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/16-008/16-008.html, OGC, 4.1 (GeoSciML); Lieberman, J., Ryan, A., (2017) OGC Underground Infrastructure Concept Study Engineering Report, , http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/17-048.html, ed's; Brodaric, B., (2017) OGC WaterML 2: Part 4 - GroundWaterML 2 (GWML2), , http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/16-032r2/16-032r2.html; (2018) White Paper on ASCE ""Standard Guideline for Recording and Exchanging Utility Infrastructure Data"", , https://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Technical-Areas/Construction-Engeering/Content-Pieces/as-built-standardswhitepaper.pdf, American Society of Civil Engineers; Yan, Jingya, Jaw, Siow Wei, Soon, Kean, Wieser, Andreas, Schrotter, Gerhard, Towards an Underground Utilities 3D Data Model for Land Administration (2019) Remote Sensing, 11, p. 1957",,Wong K.Ellul C.Morley J.Home R.Kalantari M.,,International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,3rd BIM/GIS Integration Workshop and 15th 3D GeoInfo Conference 2020,7 September 2020 through 11 September 2020,,162866,16821750,,,,English,"Int.

A Bayesian change point detection methodology is tentatively embedded to reveal the suspicious asset anomalies in a real time manner. A demonstrator on cooling pumps is developed and implemented based on Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB) West Cambridge Digital Twin Pilot.

Having these platforms unmanned and remotely operated would improve the field economy, reduce the personnel risk and minimize the environmental footprint. The use of subsea mindset and technology in the platform design can enable such a shift in the manning and operations regime. Unmanned platforms have been in operation for decades in the form of simple platforms without complex process functions. The frequency of visits has however, turned out to be quite high. Further, maintaining facilities as unmanned has proved challenging when processing functions are added. To enable full-processing platforms to operate as unmanned installations, a new approach to design can be adopted. This new approach is characterized by use of design principles for complex subsea processing facilities and benefitting from the digital revolution. A main difference when comparing subsea and topside processing facilities is the significant number of utilities, support and safety functions on a platform. For the new platform concept proposed, several of these functions are simplified or eliminated, which reduces complexity, the need for maintenance and cost. The platform concept is among others proposed without accommodation and helideck. Access by personnel and evacuation is via bridge to Service Operation Vessel. By examining the Mean Time Between Failure for topside vs subsea equipment, it is evident that the subsea equipment has higher availability and requires less maintenance. For the topside equipment which as of today is maintenance intensive, e.g. compressors and pumps, the concept includes using subsea derived equipment. Seal-less subsea derived compressors are already proven for topside application. The maintenance need is determined based on surveillance by sensors and predictive analytics, i.e. predictive maintenance. On a staffed facility there are cranes and trolleys for material handling and personnel are carrying out in-situ inspection and repairs, representing a significant number of offshore man-hours. For Subsea installations, the principle is plug & play replacement by use of intervention vessels. The layout of the new platform concept is arranged in a subsea derived manner adopting the replacement principle by use of vessels. Also, the platform is proposed with robotics tailored for intervention of minor items. New technologies as drones and crawlers are developing rapidly and are used for inspection tasks replacing personnel, in addition to sensors and cameras and in combination with a digital twin. These technologies are comparable to using ROV for inspection of subsea equipment. This paper will present the conceptual idea for the subsea derived full-processing unmanned platform in more detail, and discuss benefits compared to a conventional staffed full-processing platform. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.",,Digital twin; Inspection; Materials handling; Offshore oil well production; Personnel; Predictive analytics; Predictive maintenance; Remotely operated vehicles; Digital revolution; Environmental footprints; Inspection and repair; Mean time between failures; Processing facilities; Processing platform; Service operations; Subsea installations; Offshore technology,,,,,,,,"https://www.akerbp.com, Hod, Tambar, Valhall Flank North, Valhall Flank South, Valhall Flank West; https://www.equinor.com, Oseberg H, Valemon, Huldra, Sleipner B; https://www.woodside.com.au, Angel; https://www.akersolutions.com, Digital Solutions-ix3, Aker Solutions to Develop Digital Twin for Wintershall's Nova Field; https://www.bhge.com, ICL-Integrated Compressor Line; https://new.siemens.com, Hermetically Sealed Compressors; https://turbomachinery.man-es.com, High-Speed Oil Free Compressor; https://turbomachinery.man-es.com/news/ivar-aasen; Yeaw, S.H., Storstenvik, A., Vesterkjær, R., (2018) Subsea COMPRESSION: Reliable and Proven Solutions to Increase Gas Fields Recovery, , Paper OTC-28527-MS, OTC Asia, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia, 20-23 March; (2015) NTNU: Oreda Handbook, , Sintef, 6th edition-Volume I Topside equipment; www.rockwellautomation.com, PowerFlex 7000 Direct-To-Drive; www.abb.com, ACS 2000 Direct-To-Line; https://www.gepowerconversion.com, MV7, Transformer-less; Oluwatoyin, S., Hashim, F., Hussin, H., Failure Mode and Effect Analysis of Subsea Multiphase Pump Equipment, , Web of Conferences. 13. 05001.10.1051/matecconf/20141305001; https://www.hugg.no/Prosjekter/Fjernstyrt-lasting-av-kjemikalier-for-NOAKA-feltet; www.gulfmark.com; www.sriemas.com; www.boa.no; www.deepoceangroup.com; https://www.sbmoffshore.com; https://www.macartney.com; Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority, , www.psa.no; Facilities Regulation, §6 Design of Simpler Facilities, , https://www.ptil.no/en/regulations/allacts/?forskrift=634; (2009) Nopsema Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety) Regulations, , https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2013C00945; http://oilinwater.com; Llewelyn, D., Selnes, P.O., (2011) 10 Year Operability Survey of Norwegian Fpsos, , The Norwegian Oil Industry Association (OLF), 15 March; https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/attachments/109746230/poster-SINAMICS-mvdrives_en.pdf, see SH150",,,,Offshore Technology Conference,"Offshore Technology Conference 2020, OTC 2020",4 May 2020 through 7 May 2020,,160167,1603663,9.78E+12,OSTCB,,English,Proc.

However, cyber attacks against ICS - especially at the communication channels between human-machine interface (HMIs) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) - are increasing at a rate which outstrips the rate of mitigation. In this paper, we introduce a vendor-agnostic analytics framework which allows security researchers to analyse attacks against ICS systems, even if the researchers have zero control automation domain knowledge or are faced with a myriad of heterogenous ICS systems. Unlike existing works that require expertise in domain knowledge and specialised tool usage, our analytics framework does not require prior knowledge about ICS communication protocols, PLCs, and expertise of any network penetration testing tool. Using 'digital twin' scenarios comprising industry-representative HMIs, PLCs and firewalls in our test lab, our framework's steps were demonstrated to successfully implement a stealthy deception attack based on false data injection attacks (FDIA). Furthermore, our framework also demonstrated the relative ease of attack dataset collection, and the ability to leverage well-known penetration testing tools. We also introduce the concept of 'heuristic inference attacks', a new family of attack types on ICS which is agnostic to PLC and HMI brands/models commonly deployed in ICS. Our experiments were also validated on a separate ICS dataset collected from a cyber-physical scenario of water utilities. Finally, we utilized time complexity theory to estimate the difficulty for the attacker to conduct the proposed packet analyses, and recommended countermeasures based on our findings. © 2020 IEEE.",Critical infrastructure; Cyber resilience; Cybersecurity; Industrial control system (ICS) security; Man-in-the-Middle attacks; Operational Technology (OT); PLC security; Security analytics framework,Ability testing; Control systems; Digital twin; Man machine systems; Programmable logic controllers; Statistical tests; Well testing; Domain knowledge; False data injection attacks; Human Machine Interface; Industrial control systems; Industry representatives; Inference attacks; Network penetration testing; Penetration testing tools; Network security,,,,,,,,"Hadziosmanovíc, D., Sommer, R., Zambon, E., Hartel, P.H., Through the eye of the plc: Semantic security monitoring for industrial processes (2014) Proceedings of the 30th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, pp. 126-135; Lan, H., Zhu, X., Sun, J., Li, S., Traffic data classification to detect man-in-the-middle attacks in industrial control system (2020) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Dependable Systems and Their Applications, pp. 430-434; Miciolino, E.E., Bernieri, G., Pascucci, F., Setola, R., Communications network analysis in a scada system testbed under cyber-attacks (2015) Proceedings of the 23rd Telecommunications Forum Telfor, pp. 341-344; Satyanarayana, P., Vulnerability analysis and enhancement of security of communication protocol in industrial control systems (2019) Helix, 9 (4), pp. 5122-5127; Gao, H., Peng, Y., Jia, K., Dai, Z., Wang, T., The design of ics testbed based on emulation, physical, and simulation (eps-ics testbed) (2013) Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, pp. 420-423; Kalle, S., Ameen, N., Yoo, H., Ahmed, I., Clik on plcs! attacking control logic with decompilation and virtual plc (2019) Proceedings of the Binary Analysis Research Workshop-BAR@NDSS; Klick, J., Lau, S., Marzin, D., Malchow, J.-O., Roth, V., Internet-facing plcs-a new back orifice (2015) Blackhat USA, pp. 22-26; Bernieri, G., Miciolino, E.E., Pascucci, F., Setola, R., Monitoring system reaction in cyber-physical testbed under cyber-attacks (2017) Computers & Electrical Engineering, 59, pp. 86-98; Kleinmann, A., Amichay, O., Wool, A., Tenenbaum, D., Bar, O., Lev, L., Stealthy deception attacks against scada systems (2017) Proceedings of the International Workshops on Computer Security-Cyber-ICPS/SECPRE@ESORICS, Ser.

Digital twins or 3D models of cities are created by utilizing 3D laser scanning, unmanned airborne vehicles (UAV) and mobile mapping systems. Photogrammetry based UAVs are increasingly used for land surveying and infrastructure mapping. In comparison to other techniques, photogrammetry can be used to collect large amount of geospatial data in relatively short time. Current techniques used to maintain and manage utility charges database often relies on long lasting field measurements and manual data collection. Such approach may result in incorrect, unreliable and outdated information about building area and floor count, which significantly affect the utility charge amount. This paper presents a methodology of establishing geospatial database by utilizing digital twin technology, photogrammetry and a fixed wing UAV with precise GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) also called GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver. Mentioned UAV has the ability of taking oblique images of terrain, buildings and infrastructure, which are then used to reconstruct 3D model (digital twin) of the city. It is presented how data extracted from 3D model is used to establish digital geospatial database containing building layouts, floor count and area. These information were compared to official data, which showed all the benefits of digital twin technology, but also all the issues of current utility charge system. Finally, the focus is turned to other applications of digital twin technology and its involvement in Industry 4.0, together with autonomous vehicles, 5G networks and IoT. © 2020 Croatian Society MIPRO.",3D city model; Digital twin technology; Geospatial database; GIS; UAV; Utility charges,3D modeling; Database systems; Digital twin; Fixed wings; Floors; Global positioning system; Mapping; Photogrammetry; Surveying; Three dimensional computer graphics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 3D Laser scanning; Field measurement; Geo-spatial database; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Gps (global positioning system); Mobile mapping systems; Outdated information; Unmanned airborne vehicles; 5G mobile communication systems,,,,,,,,"https://www.zakon.hr/z/319/Zakon-o-komunalnom-gospodarstvu, Law for Utility Charges (in Croatian); http://www.vodnjan.hr/hr/komunalna-naknada/sto-jekomunalna-naknada-i-tko-je-placa; https://www.zakon.hr/z/241/Zakon-o-vlasnistvu-i-drugimstvarnim-pravima, Law on ownership and other real rights (in Croatian); Lisjak, J., Cetl, V., Markovinovi, D., Establishing spatial database for utility charges-integration of different needs for geodetic data and services (Cadaster of buildings, real estate tax) (2016) (in Croarian), 9.

In this study we introduce methods to construct and validate a subject-specific four-chamber porcine heart model suitable to investigate coupled electro-mechanical phenomena from in vivo data. Our geometrically detailed, electromechanical four-chamber heart was mechanically calibrated to match the experimentally recorded LV pressure-volume loop. Surfaces of the LV and RV from the model were validated against surfaces extracted from in vivo CT scans, which correlated well (R2 =0.94, 0.95 respectively) over all phases. Validated model function is compared with simulations of AV block in the same subject. Our findings show that in addition to interrupted flow, AV block creates elevated stress and strain throughout the heart during diastole following the missed ventricular beat. The ventricles, unable to unload, are subjected to increased pressures and volumes which peak during the atrial kick. At this point mean ventricular stress were elevated by 50% (3.0 vs. 4.5 kPa, normal vs. AV block).

Recently, power converters with grid-forming capabilities have attracted interest from researchers and utilities as keystone devices enabling modern microgrid architectures. Therefore, proper and thorough testing of Grid-Forming Inverters (GFMIs) is crucial to understand their dynamics and limitations before they are deployed. The use of closed-loop real-time Power Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) simulations will facilitate the testing of GFMIs using a digital twin of the power system under various contingency scenarios within a controlled environment. So far, lower to medium scale commercially available GFMIs are difficult to interface into PHIL simulations because of their lack of a synchronization mechanism that allows a smooth and stable interconnection with a voltage source such as a power amplifier. Under this scenario, the use of the well-known Ideal Transformer Method to create a PHIL setup can lead to catastrophic damages of the GFMI. This paper addresses a simple but novel method to interface commercially available GFMIs into a PHIL testbed. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is stable and accurate under standalone operation with abrupt (step) load-changing dynamics, followed by the corresponding steady state behavior. Such results were validated against the dynamics of the GFMI connected to a linear load bank. © 2020 IEEE.",Grid-forming inverters; microgrids models; power-hardware-in-the-loop; simulation models,Digital twin; Dynamics; Electric inverters; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Microgrids; Power amplifiers; Synthetic apertures; Catastrophic damage; Controlled environment; Microgrid architecture; Power hardware in the loops; Power Hardwarein-the-Loop (PHIL); Stand-alone operation; Steady-state behaviors; Synchronization mechanisms; Electric power transmission networks,,,,,DE-NA-0003525,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-mission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC. a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International, Inc., for the U.S Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA-0003525.",,"Abi-Samra, N., (2017) Power Grid Resiliency for Adverse Conditions, , San Diego: Artech House; Walker, B.J., (2019) Developing A Resilience Model for North America's Energy Sector Infrastructure, , Washington, DC; Lasseter, R.H., Piagi, P., Microgrid: A conceptual solution (2004) PESC; (2015) The Role of Microgrids in Helping to Advance the Nation's Energy System | Department of Energy, , https://www.energy.gov/oe/activities/technology-development/gridmodernization-and-smart-grid/role-microgrids-helping, DOE.

Cast resin transformers are not flammable and are also resistant to moisture. However, their thermalelectrical degradation must be carefully analysed given the special conditions of wind farm installations. The present paper studies the remaining useful life (RUL) calculation of dry-type WTSU transformers based on the most thermally stressed location i.e. the winding hot-spot. The estimation of the loss of life of the transformer can be used for diagnostic and prognostic monitoring purposes in the framework of digital twins. The methodology is then applied to a typical WTSU load profile and the impact of several transformer characteristics and operating conditions are compared to the reference case. © 2020, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

Wading through the hype of these promises is difficult, but critical if utilities are going to be successful at delivering resilient systems for the future. The Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) of Greater Hartford, Connecticut turned to a digital twin to help analyze and predict system performance, a tool that delivers real-time insights from the MDC’s system, as well as forecasts future performance of planned improvements to ensure that the MDC will be successful with its long-term planning objectives. This technology has helped the MDC adapt its current operating procedures and incorporate resiliency into its long-term capital improvements. Resiliency can be difficult to plan for given changing and intensifying weather patterns, however, the tool delivers Hartford insight into likely future performance of planned facilities for each storm event that occurs across its system. Leveraging its digital twin, the MDC has a mechanism to apply analysis of its system performance with simulated performances of future build-out scenarios to evaluate effectiveness and the overall future system’s success.

Traditional APM combines IT data and OT data with big data analytics to define a course of action that will improve business outcomes. This paper introduces a new concept for APM, Visual Asset Performance Management (Visual APM), that adds an asset information layer to APM. A Visual APM solution uses navigable 2D and 3D models to deliver ""living"" digital twins of equipment, machinery, and processes. It creates a centralized information repository to provide a seamless, contextualized view of data. This approach integrates interactive visualizations of equipment and plants with real-time data and analytics that teams can leverage to inspect asset health and monitor business performance in real time. Visual APM represents a paradigm shift for conventional Asset Performance Management, presenting a new way for engineers, operators, and maintenance teams to interact with asset information throughout its entire life cycle to reduce CAPEX and OPEX. The ability to quickly access asset and plant information and visualize asset performance can help increase the overall health of a facility significantly. A top 10 Oil &amp; Gas company that has adopted this approach achieved the following results: • Cut maintenance costs such as corrosion under insulation by 10-20% • Shortened the time spent in the planning inspections process by up to 60% while improving the quality of the planning • Achieved overall improvement in the effectiveness of campaigns and minimized rework • Reduced health, safety, and environmental hazards • Digitized the input of inspection results through handheld devices • Increased the accuracy of data captures in the field • Enhanced reporting capabilities. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Advanced Analytics; Corrosion; Data Analytics; Decision making; Digital twin; Gas hazards; Gas industry; Gasoline; Health; Health hazards; Human resource management; Inspection; Life cycle; Machinery; Operating costs; Public utilities; Visualization; Business performance; Centralized informations; Corrosion under insulations; Health , safety , and environmental; Information layers; Interactive visualizations; Performance management; Reliability and availability; Costs",,,,,,,,"Asset Performance Management (APM) Gartner Glossary, , https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/asset-performancemanagement-apm, Gartner.

Drilling of wells, predictivemaintenance and digital fields are examples for the use of these technologies. In hydrocarbon productionforecasting, numerical reservoir models and ""digital twins"" of reservoirs have been used for decades.However, increasing computing power and Artificial Intelligence recently enabled oil and gas companiesto generate ""digital siblings"" of reservoirs (model ensembles) covering the uncertainty range in staticdata (e.g. petrophysics, geological structure), dynamic data (e.g. oil or gas properties) and economics(Capital Expenditures, Operating Expenditures). Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are appliedto condition the model ensembles to measured data and improve hydrocarbon production forecasting underuncertainty. The model ensembles can be used for quantitative decision making under uncertainty. This allowscompanies to shorten the time for field (re-)development planning and to develop into learning organizationsfor decision making. These developments require companies to change the way of working in hydrocarbon productionforecasting and decision analysis. Additional skills need to be developed in companies to embracedigitalization. Data science-which is considered a key skill in digitalization-has not been identified ascrucial in skills development of oil and gas companies in the past. However, for data driven decision making,advanced data analytics skills and data science skills are a pre-requisite. To overcome this skill gap, staffneeds to be trained and graduates with data science and profound physical and chemical skills need to behired. Furthermore, skills development has to address the challenge of incorrect use of Machine Learningtechnologies and the risks of Artificial Intelligence leading to erroneous optimizations. In particularinterpretability of AI needs to be covered in skills development. © 2020 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

One important component of the transmission line is the conductor and transmission line asset managers are responsible for decisions on how to maintain and, when necessary, replace conductors currently in service. The decision-making process requires reliable long-term and up-to-date information on the state and condition of the conductors. Currently, most asset managers lack such information. LineVision is a company that provides non-contact transmission line monitoring of conductor assets. Originally developed for Dynamic Line Rating (DLR), the LineVision systems collect information that is invaluable for utility asset managers. An Asset Health Module (AHM) has been developed which creates an asset digital twin, integrating both historical and real-time data from the target transmission line in order to compute its baseline Asset Health. These inputs include high-temperature cycling, extreme sag and blowout forces, occurrences of galloping and their intensity, vibration and precipitation loads from icing, and other events the conductor experiences during its lifetime which negatively impact asset health. Without monitoring equipment many of these events go unrecorded and even unnoticed unless they cause catastrophic failures which can be dangerous, cause forced service interruptions, and take months or years to repair. The AHM integrates engineering specifications of the design, information collected after a line is built, and real-time field measurements obtained via a field-based monitoring system. Based on field measurements, an extensive proprietary model determines the operating conditions and the asset health of the transmission line conductor. The output of the system is a real-time, continuous assessment of a transmission line’s operational condition and an estimate of the conductor’s remaining life based on the historical and collected data, industry standards, and proprietary conductor analysis. The AHM can assist asset managers and system operators to prioritize the criticality of multiple monitored sections. The AHM improves line reliability, overall system reliability and can lead to significant cost savings by supporting asset management decisions, such as postponed conductor replacement which is the costliest conductor asset decision. The details of the AHM and the approaches it uses along with the benefits for transmission line operators will be discussed in the paper. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Asset management; Conductor asset health model; DLR; Dynamic Line Rating; Remote sensing; Transmission grid reliability improvement; Transmission grid safety; Transmission line monitoring,Asset management; Decision making; Decision support systems; Digital twin; Electric lines; Health; Managers; Reliability; Remote sensing; Voltage measurement; Decision making process; Dynamic line rating(DLR); Dynamic line ratings; Electrical transmission; Engineering specification; High temperature cycling; Transmission grids; Transmission line monitoring; Transmissions,,,,,,"Authors would like to acknowledge the support and feedback from other LineVision members, Hudson Gilbert CEO, Nathan Pinney CTO.",,"Guide for Application of Direct Real-Time Monitoring Systems (2012) Technical Brochure, p. 498; Harvey, J.R., Effect of elevated temperature operation on the strength of aluminum conductors (1971) IEEE PES Winter Meeting Paper T, pp. 72-189; Harvey, J.R., Effect of elevated temperature operation on the strength of aluminum conductors (1972) IEEE Trans, (5), pp. 1769-1772; Connectors and Accessories (2004) IEEE Standard, pp. 1283-2004; Morgan, V.T., The loss of tensile strength of hard-drawn conductors by annealing in service (1979) IEEE Trans.

It incorporates a routing algorithm to build vehicle routes and an upper confidence bound based algorithm for a generalized linear contextual bandit algorithm to identify alternatives which are acceptable to passengers. As a contextual bandit algorithm, the added context from the routing subproblem makes it unclear how effective learning is under such circumstances. We propose a new simulation experimental framework to evaluate the impact of adding the routing constraints to the destination recommender algorithm. The proposed algorithm is first tested on a 7 by 7 grid network and performs better than benchmarks that include random alternatives, selecting the highest rating, or selecting the destination with the smallest vehicle routing cost increase. The RecoMOD algorithm also reduces average increases in vehicle travel costs compared to using random or highest rating recommendation. Its application to Manhattan dataset with ratings for 1,012 destinations reveals that a higher customer arrival rate and faster vehicle speeds lead to better acceptance rates. While these two results sound contradictory, they provide important managerial insights for MOD operators.

However, the data transmission bandwidth and sensor placement limitations in the physical systems may not allow us to collect the amount or the type of data that we wish. Recently, a physics-based compressive sensing (PBCS) approach was proposed to monitor manufacturing processes and obtain high-fidelity information with the reduced number of sensors by incorporating physical models of processes in compressed sensing. It can recover and reconstruct complete three-dimensional temperature distributions based on some limited measurements. In this paper, a constrained orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is developed for PBCS, where coherence exists between the measurement matrix and the basis matrix. The efficiency of recovery is improved by introducing a boundary-domain reduction approach, which reduces the size of PBCS model matrices during the inverse operations. The improved PBCS method is demonstrated with the measurement of temperature distributions in the cooling and real-time printing processes of fused filament fabrication. © 2021 by ASME",Compressed sensing; Computational foundations for additive manufacturing; Digital twin; Inverse methods for engineering applications; PDE constrained optimization; Physics-based compressive sensing; Process modeling for engineering applications; Process monitoring,3D printers; Compressed sensing; Digital twin; Inverse problems; Temperature distribution; Additive manufacturing process; Compressive sensing; Inverse operation; Manufacturing process; Measurement matrix; Measurement of temperature; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Three dimensional temperature distributions; Matrix algebra,,,,,,,,"Tao, F., Zhang, M., Nee, A.

Therefore, using measured data to analyze the safety of equipment operation will become an important application of digital twin technology. This paper proposes a switching transient overvoltage modeling method for circuit breakers in distribution networks based on measured data. Through collecting the actual operation data of the 10 kV distribution network circuit breaker, the key operation parameters of the circuit breaker are extracted and the model parameters are iterated and modified accordingly. Moreover, the simulation model can reflect the status of the current operating equipment and improve the reliability of the analysis results. The simulation results show that the maximum distribution overvoltage calculated by this model is 3.88, and it is closer to the measured value compared with the traditional model. This model can be used to analyze the operation safety of distribution network circuit breaker. © 2021, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

First, an asynchronous real-time HIL simulation platform is introduced to enable multi-rate co-simulation of a distribution system with many inverter-based distributed energy resources (DERs). The distribution system is modeled by milliseconds phasor-based models and the DERs are modeled by micro-seconds power electronic models. Communication connections between a centralized volt-var controller (modeled externally to the HIL testbed) and smart inverters are built by implementing Modbus links and the Long Term Evolution network. On this co-simulation platform, an enhanced, augmented Lagrangian multiplier based encoded data recovery (EALM-EDR) algorithm for mitigating the impact of unreliable communication is developed and validated. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of using the HIL-based co-simulation platform as a power grid digital twin for developing algorithms that coordinate a large number of heterogeneous control systems through wired and wireless communication links. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Augmented Lagrangian multiplier; data recovery; distribution; hardware-in-the-loop; volt-var control,Constrained optimization; Digital twin; Electric inverters; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Encoding (symbols); Energy resources; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Lagrange multipliers; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Signal encoding; Value engineering; Augmented Lagrangians; Communication connection; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution systems; Encoding methods; Hardware in the loops; Heterogeneous control; Wired and wireless communications; Simulation platform,,,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Pacific Northwest National lab, Total S.A., and the Department of Energy SunLamp Program for its support to this research project.",,"(1547) Photovoltaics, Distributed Generation, and Energy Storage, IEEE Standard for Interconnection and Interoperability of Distributed Energy Resources with Associated Electric Power Systems Interfaces-Amendment 1: To Provide More Flexibility for Adoption of Abnormal Operating Performance Category III, , IEEE Standard-2018, 2018; Baker, K., Bernstein, A., Dall'Anese, E., Zhao, C., Network-cognizant voltage droop control for distribution grids (2018) IEEE Trans.

Researchers have developed many HIL test systems for power systems in recent years. Those test systems can model both microsecond-level dynamic responses of power electronic systems and millisecond-level transients of transmission and distribution grids. By integrating individual HIL test systems into a network of HIL test systems, we can create large-scale power grid digital twins with flexible structures at required modeling resolution that fits for a wide range of system operating conditions. This will not only significantly reduce the need for field tests when developing new technologies but also greatly shorten the model development cycle. In this paper, we present a networked OPAL-RT based HIL test system for developing transmission-distribution coordinative Volt-VAr regulation technologies as an example to illustrate system setups, communication requirements among different HIL simulation systems, and system connection mechanisms. Impacts of communication delays, information exchange cycles, and computing delays are illustrated. Simulation results show that the performance of a networked HIL test system is satisfactory. © 2021 IEEE.",Co-simulation; digital twin; distribution system; hardware-in-the-loop; transmission system; Volt-VAR control,Digital twin; Electric power transmission networks; Flexible structures; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Test facilities; Communication delays; Hardwarein-the-loop(HIL) simulation; Information exchanges; Large-scale power systems; Model development; Operating condition; Power electronic systems; Transmission and distribution; Large scale systems,,,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, University of Texan at Austin Semiconductor Power Electronics Center, Total S.A., and the Department of Energy SunLamp Program for their support to this work.",,"Thornton, M., Internet-of-things hardware-in-The-loop simulation architecture for providing frequency regulation with demand response (2017) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 14 (11), pp. 5020-5028; Kim, Y.-J., Wang, J., Power hardware-in-The-loop simulation study on frequency regulation through direct load control of thermal and electrical energy storage resources (2016) IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 9 (4), pp. 2786-2796; Xie, F., An asynchronous real-time co-simulation platform for modeling interaction between microgrids and power distribution systems (2019) IEEE PES General Meeting; Ke, X., Coordinative real-time sub-transmission volt-var control for reactive power regulation between transmission and distribution systems (2018) IET Generation, Transmission & Distribution, 13 (11), pp. 2006-2014; McEntee, C., A VSM-based der dispatch MINLP for volt-VAR control in unbalanced power distribution systems (2019) IEEE PES General Meeting; Combined Transmission and Distribution Test System for Integration of Distributed Solar Photovoltaic Generation, , https://pnnltestsystem.github.io/PNNL-NCSU-Combined-transmission-distribution-system/, online; Samaan, N., Combined transmission and distribution test system to study high penetration of distributed solar generation (2018) 2018 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition (T&D); Wang, J., Load aggregation methods for quasi-static power flow analysis on high PV penetration feeders (2018) 2018 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition (T&D); IEEE Standard for Interconnection and Interoperability of Distributed Energy Resources with Associated Electric Power Systems Interfaces, , https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1547-2018.html, IEEE 1547-2018; Ma, L., Xu, Y., Huang, A.Q., A study of physical limitation of reactive power output capability of modern PV inverters (2018) 2018 IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition (T&D); IEEE 123 Node Test Feeder, , https://site.ieee.org/pes-testfeeders/resources/; Long, Q., Yu, H., Xie, F., Microgrid power flow control with integrated battery management functions (2020) IEEE PES General Meeting",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"52nd North American Power Symposium, NAPS 2020",11 April 2021 through 13 April 2021,,170924,,9.78E+12,,,English,"North Am.

Therefore, this paper investigates the Digital Twin technology for power system loads with a novel parameter identification method based on Bayesian Inference. A framework for load model Digital Twins is proposed based on an existing model, and a novel approach to load model identification is investigated and compared to existing methods. Even though Bayesian Inference relies on prior knowledge of the model, compared to other approaches, it returns a Probability Density Function for the whole model and each model parameter and fares very well with sparse data as well as an increased level of measurement noise. The results promise to use Bayesian Inference as the primary identification method for a Digital Twin as proposed in this paper.

This conversion is driving the expansion of renewable energy facilities such as photovoltaic plants and wind power plants. Except for large hydropower plants and offshore wind farms, the integration of renewable energies takes place predominantly in the medium- and low-voltage distribution networks. This leads to a lack of observability and increasing grid complexity. Consequently, distribution network operators are constantly faced with a challenge in terms of observability. A comprehensive installation of measuring instruments in the medium- and low-voltage networks has proved economically unviable. An alternative approach to network state monitoring within the framework of power grid digital twin (DT) is therefore developed in this paper. The patterns of the electrical energy system are detected and modeled employing an artificial neural network (ANN) in connection with the associated harmonic spectra. Based on this DT model, the active powers of renewable energy facilities are estimated through the measured voltage data. In this regard, this work is first devoted to the modeling of an ANN-based DT estimator. The proposed power state estimation is then validated with the measured data from a field test.

The traditional transmission line modeling method has the defects of insufficient spatial positioning ability and weak information expression ability. Therefore, in this paper, three-dimensional geographic information system (3D GIS) and grid information model (GIM) are coordinated to make the two complementary advantages and construct the three-dimensional scene of transmission line corridor. First, The visible light images and high-precision laser point cloud data of transmission line corridor are collected by helicopter, and extract power lines and towers from the laser point cloud data. Then, the oblique photogrammetric model of large-scale scene is made from visible light images and modified. Finally, according to the point cloud of power line and tower, the improved template matching method is used to realize the rapid modeling of transmission line GIM model, and the transmission line model is obtained. A complete 3D digital twin scene model of transmission line corridor is formed by fusing scene model and transmission line model. The research results show that the 3D scene construction method of transmission line corridor based on 3D GIS and GIM not only improves the efficiency of transmission line modeling, but also has a good visual effect. The abundant line information is helpful for the visual operation and maintenance management of existing transmission lines from macro to micro, which provides data support for the construction of digital power grid. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The overall framework, operation process and key technologies of the system implementation is established, using the Zigbee self-organizing network function to monitor and collect real-time data such as wind speed, gas and dust concentration in the roadway. The ARIMA time series prediction model is used to intelligently predict and analyze the gas and dust concentration at the next moment, moreover the niche four-segment coding genetic algorithm is introduced to extract the corresponding intelligent control rules of airflow, and combined with GPRS wireless transmission technology to realize the intelligent control of airflow status of air outlet. On this basis, Unity3D is used to construct the virtual model of the system and realize the mapping interaction between the physical entity and the virtual twin. Through the design and construction of the digital twin system experimental test platform, the technical feasibility of system's key function such as real-time monitoring, decision-making evaluation, intelligent control, and virtual-real integration are verified, besides combined with specific cases to compare and analyze the intelligent control effect of system. The results shows that after adjustment, the wind speed at the driver's position increases significantly. The gas concentration at the top corner is reduced from 0.623% to 0.306%, and the reduction rate reaches 50.8%. The dust concentration at the driver's position is reduced from 1 180 mg/m3 to 695 mg/m3, and the single-point dust reduction rate reached 41.1%, the dust concentration along the pedestrian height at the return air side is reduced from 430 mg/m3 to 150 mg/m3, and the dust re-duction rate reaches 65%, which further optimize the distribution of wind speed, gas and dust field in the heading face. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of China Coal Society.

The advanced digital twin technology is introduced into tooth flank grinding. A new digital twin modeling considering low-risk transmission performances is proposed. In the modeling, low-risk transmission performance driven simulation, sensitivity analysis and robust control are developed, respectively Firstly, data-driven tooth surface modeling is developed by simulating free-form tooth surface grinding including gear tilt method and pinion double helical method. With local geometric boundary setup meshing stiffness is determined by using local Rayleigh–Ritz solution. Then, to deal with the sensitivity of gear assembly, an improved tooth contact analysis (TCA) is developed. Moreover, numerical loaded tooth contact analysis (NLTCA) is performed to build a bridge between of low-risk performances and hypoid generator parameters. The low-risk transmission performance driven control model is established by using hypoid generator parameters modification. Finally, sensitivity analysis strategy-based robust control model is solved by using Levenberg–Marquardt method for accurate hypoid generator parameters having modification amount. The provided numerical instance can verify the proposed method. © 2021 ISA",Digital twin modeling; Free-form tooth surface grinding; Low-risk transmission performance; Non-orthogonal aviation spiral bevel gears;

Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model's security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system's multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100&#x0025; successful transmission probability and 0.01~0.05 &#x03BB; value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.

DTs are designed to increase observability for state estimation of the inverter-dominant distribution grid. With the increasing complexity of the power grid, demand to use state estimation increases to maintain the grid stability of operation. Based on the metered data from the phasor measurement unit, an online model, the so-called DT, can be created to monitor the current grid status. It can be used for state prediction and event forecasting also. In this paper, the state estimation of the inverter dominated grid formulated by the DT model. To build the model, the artificial neural network and singular value decomposition-based system identification are utilized to emulate the dynamic feature of the inverter. The training data set of the neural network in the DT model is obtained from the reference model, which is created based on traditional dynamic state equations of inverter and power grid. To validate the accuracy of the DT model, the simulation results of the reference model are first compared with the results of the DT model after the training process. Afterward, two additional scenarios are simulated using DT based on the Cigré benchmark grid to validate the accuracy of state estimation in the power grid. © VDE VERLAG GMBH. Berlin.

In this paper, posture perception, numerical simulation, and risk assessment are adopted to realize the deep fusion of physical trajectory and spatial virtual electric field distribution of live worker, and digital twin bodies of live worker in different live working scenarios are constructed. Firstly, posture trajectories and 3D model of living worker in typical operation conditions are captured and reconstructed by full-body inertial action capture technology and this technology use motion capture unit which include 3-aixs accelerometer/gyroscope/magnetic field sensors. The length of complex gap and body workspace under various live work scenes are also calculated. By static electrical field finite element (FE) numerical modeling, surface electrical field distributions of live worker under different posture trajectories are then calculated. Finally, interactive mechanism between 'body-information-physical environment-virtual environment' is introduced, and potential risk of live worker is on-line assessed by live work guide rules. This work develops a new assessment and protection method for virtual training and field operations of high-voltage live worker. Which is of great significance for enhancing operation level and ensuring living workers' safety. © 2013 IEEE.",data twin; intelligence; Live work,Digital twin; Electric fields; Electric lines; Numerical models; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Three dimensional computer graphics; Trajectories; Transmissions; High voltage transmission lines; Motion capture units; Operation conditions; Physical environments; Protection methods; Surface electrical fields; Virtual electric field; Working environment; Occupational risks,,,,,038700KK52170007,"This work was supported by the Science and Technology Project of Guangdong Power Grid Company Ltd., under Project 038700KK52170007.",,"Method of operation of live working, Electric Power Press, State Grid Corp.

Therefore, it is important to learn about the methods in which companies minimize the negative effects of their activities. The article presents the steps taken and innovative actions carried out by enterprises in the energy sector. The article analyzes innovative activities undertaken and implemented by enterprises from the energy sector. The relationships between innovative strategies, including, inter alia, digitization, and Industry 4.0 solutions, in the development of companies and the achieved results concerning sustainable development and environmental impact. Digitization has far exceeded traditional productivity improvement ranges of 3–5% per year, with a clear cost improvement potential of well above 25%. Enterprises on a large scale make attempts to increase energy efficiency by implementing the state-of-the-art innovative technical and technological solutions, which increase reliability and durability (material and mechanical engineering). Digitization of energy companies allows them to reduce operating costs and increases efficiency. With digital advances, the useful life of an energy plant can be increased up to 30%. Advanced technologies, blockchain, and the use of intelligent networks enables the activation of prosumers in the electricity market. Reducing energy consumption in industry and at the same time increasing energy efficiency for which the European Union is fighting in the clean air package for all Europeans have a positive impact on environmental protection, sustainable development, and the implementation of the decarbonization program.

This work reveals that too much research attention was invested in making data-driven models, as supposed to ensuring the quality of industrial data. Furthermore, the true challenge within the Industry 4.0 is with data communication and infrastructure problems, not so significantly on developing modelling techniques. Current methods and data infrastructures for industrial energy savings were comprehensively reviewed to showcase the potential for a more accurate and effective digital twin-based infrastructure for the industry. With a few more development in enabling technologies such as 5G developments, Internet of Things (IoT) standardization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain 3.0 utilization, it is but a matter of time that the industry will transition towards the digital twin-based approach. Global government efforts and policies are already inclining towards leveraging better industrial energy efficiencies and energy savings. This provides a promising future for the development of a digital twin-based energy-saving system in the industry. Foreseeing some potential challenges, this paper also discusses the importance of symbiosis between researchers and industrialists to transition from traditional industry towards a digital twin-based energy-saving industry. The novelty of this work is the current context of industrial energy savings was extended towards cutting-edge technologies for Industry 4.0. Furthermore, this work proposes to standardize and modularize industrial data infrastructure for smart energy savings. This work also serves as a concise guideline for researchers and industrialists who are looking to implement advanced energy-saving systems. © 2020",Artificial intelligence (AI); Blockchain; Cyber-physical production systems (CPPS); Data-driven energy savings; Digital twins; Internet of things (IoT),5G mobile communication systems; Artificial intelligence; Digital twin; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Knowledge based systems; Cutting edge technology; Data infrastructure; Enabling technologies; Energy saving systems; Industrial energy efficiency; Internet of Things (IOT); Modelling techniques; Traditional industry; Energy conservation,,,,,"Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT: CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008413; Ministerio de EducaciÃ³n, Cultura y Deporte, MECD","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic under OP RDE [grant number CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008413] ?Strategic Partnership for Environmental Technologies and Energy Production?.","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic under OP RDE [grant number CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008413 ] “Strategic Partnership for Environmental Technologies and Energy Production”.",,"Touš, M.; Brno University of Technology, Technicka 2896/2, Czech Republic; email: tous@fme.vutbr.cz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among other measures for stimulating consumers’ behavior changes based on attention triggers, personalized recommendations are essential to enhance sustainable progress towards energy efficiency. In light of this challenge, the current study focuses on innovative energy services that are based on intelligent recommendation systems and digital twins. We review several trends associated with the modeling and diffusion of energy services, taking into account the positive interrelationships existing between recommendation provisions and demand-side consumer energy behavior. This is achieved by means of a content analysis of the state-of-the-art works, focusing on the IEEE Xplore and Scopus databases. Based on this review, we present new empirical evidence to validate data-driven twin technologies as novel ways of implementing consumer-oriented demand-side management via sophisticated abstraction of consumers energy behaviors, and identify various barriers associated with the adoption of energy services, especially as they relate to the implementation and overall adoption of the digital-twins concept. Lastly, we use the review to summarize a coherent policy recommendations related to the wide-spread adoption of the digital-twins concept, and demand-side management solutions in general. © 2021 The Author(s)",Demand side management; Digital twins; Energy efficiency; Innovative energy services; Recommender systems,Demand side management; Digital twin; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Recommender systems; Behavior change; Content analysis; Energy services; Innovative solutions; Personalized recommendation; Policy recommendations; Scopus database; State of the art; Consumer behavior,,,,,"European Commission, EC; Eesti Teadusagentuur, ETAg: PRG658; Israel Science Foundation, ISF: 1227/18; European Social Fund, ESF","The work of A.

Digital Twin is a promising technology to empower the digital transformation of IIoT by creating virtual models of physical objects. However, the provision of network efficiency in IIoT is very challenging due to resource-constrained devices, stochastic tasks, and resources heterogeneity. Distributed resources in IIoT networks can be efficiently exploited through computation offloading to reduce energy consumption while enhancing data processing efficiency. In this article, we first propose a new paradigm digital twin network to build network topology and the stochastic task arrival model in IIoT systems. Then, we formulate the stochastic computation offloading and resource allocation problem to minimize the long-term energy efficiency. As the formulated problem is a stochastic programming problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem into a deterministic per-time slot problem. Finally, we present asynchronous actor-critic algorithm to find the optimal stochastic computation offloading policy. Illustrative results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is able to significantly outperforms the benchmarks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Computation offloading; deep reinforcement learning (DRL); digital twin; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT),Data handling; Deep learning; Digital twin; E-learning; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Telecommunication equipment; Topology; Actor-critic algorithm; Computation offloading; Digital transformation; Optimization techniques; Reduce energy consumption; Resource allocation problem; Resourceconstrained devices; Stochastic computations; Industrial internet of things (IIoT),,,,,"201805052ZD3CG36, TII-20-2387; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61941102","Manuscript received May 10, 2020; revised July 9, 2020; accepted August 9, 2020.

However, the large amount of data, the limited resources of Internet of Things devices, and the increasing concerns of data privacy, are major obstacles to improve the quality of services in IIoT. In this article, we propose the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) by incorporating digital twin into edge networks to fill the gap between physical systems and digital spaces. We further leverage the federated learning to construct digital twin models of IoT devices based on their running data. Moreover, to mitigate the communication overhead, we propose an asynchronous model update scheme and formulate the federated learning scheme as an optimization problem. We further decompose the problem and solve the subproblems based on the deep neural network model. Numerical results show that our proposed federated learning scheme for DITEN improves the communication efficiency and reduces the transmission energy cost. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Communication efficiency; digital twin; energy cost; federated learning; Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT),5G mobile communication systems; Data privacy; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Digital devices; Digital twin; E-learning; Energy efficiency; Learning systems; Asynchronous models; Communication efficiency; Communication overheads; Emerging applications; Neural network model; Numerical results; Optimization problems; Transmission energy; Industrial internet of things (IIoT),,,,,"TII-20-1836, U1603261; TICPSH202003016-ZC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61941102","Manuscript received April 10, 2020; revised June 17, 2020; accepted July 4, 2020.

In order to battle the impending threat of climate change, consumers and industry must adopt sustainable transport that complies with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of increased energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. To fulfil these objectives, a new class of vehicles has recently emerged, smart electric vehicles, which is forecasted to reduce carbon dioxide emissions up to 43% as compared to diesel engine vehicles. However, to bring these vehicles to the mainstream, supporting architecture is needed to optimize them in a sustainable manner. One such novel architecture is Digital Twin Technology, which is a virtual mapping technology, extending from it, capable of investigating the lifecycle of multisystem bodies in a digital environment. In recent years, digital twin technology is becoming an underpinning area of research globally. As a result, novel individual research covering digital twin implementation on various aspects of smart vehicles has transpired in research and industrial studies, consequently allowing digital twin technology to evolve over the years. This work aims to bridge the gap between individual research to provide a comprehensive review from a technically-informed and academically neutral standpoint. Conceptual groundwork of digital twin technology is built systematically for the reader, to allow insight into its inception and evolution. The study sifts the digital twin domain for contributions in smart vehicle systems, exploring its potential and contemporaneous challenges to realization. The study then proceeds to review recent research and commercial projects for innovation within this domain. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first extensive review of the application of digital twin technology in smart electric vehicles. The review has been systematically classified into specific domains within the smart vehicle system such as autonomous navigation control, advanced driver assistance systems, vehicle health monitoring, battery management systems, vehicle power electronics, and electrical power drive systems. An in-depth discussion of each vehicle subsystem is undertaken to present this review as an eclectic panorama of the smart vehicle system. This review further facilitates appreciation of the role of digital twin technology within each classification from a holistic technical perspective. Finally, the work ends with an inspection of the techno-socio-economic impact of digital twin technology that will revolutionize mainstream vehicle technology and the obstacles for further development. © 2021",Battery management system; Digital twin; Intelligent charging; IoT; Power converter; Smart electric vehicles; Sustainable transportation; Vehicle health monitoring,Advanced driver assistance systems; Automobile drivers; Battery management systems; Carbon dioxide; Digital twin; Electric automobiles; Electric power system control; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial research; Life cycle; Monitoring; Sustainable development; Autonomous navigation; Carbon dioxide emissions; Commercial projects; Digital environment; Socio-economic impacts; Sustainable transport; Vehicle health monitoring; Vehicle technology; Economic and social effects,,,,,VIT University,"This work was supported by Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), India through SEED Grant.

The case study is focused on Rinascimento III in Rome, an area consisting of 16 eight-floor buildings with 216 apartment units powered by 70% of self-renewable energy. The combined use of integrated dynamic analysis algorithms has allowed the evaluation of different scenarios of energy efficiency intervention aimed at achieving a virtuous energy management of the complex, keeping the actual internal comfort and climate conditions. Meanwhile, the objective is also to plan and deploy a cost-effective IT (information technology) infrastructure able to provide reliable data using edge-computing paradigm. Therefore, the developed methodology led to the evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of integrative systems for renewable energy production from solar energy necessary to raise the threshold of self-produced energy, meeting the nZEB (near zero energy buildings) requirements. © 2021 by the authors.

A newly developed k-fold swarm learning framework is the key to the Hi-PSO scheme, which runs k groups (folds) of individual local optimization (using a selected learning cycle), and validation (using the other k-1 testing cycles) with the concept of digital twin introduced into the design of the HESA. It aims to achieve the optimum energy recovery efficiency globally in both learning cycles and testing cycles. Within the learning framework, a nearest-neighborhood particle swarm learning algorithm is developed to incorporate human knowledge (e.g., ISO standards) for local optimization so that the computational load can be reduced through downsizing of the learning spaces. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the energy recovery and damping performance under both local conditions (duty cycles used for learning) and global conditions (six duty cycles covering the main equivalent amplitudes and frequencies of the suspension's operation). Compared with the conventional PSO algorithm, Hi-PSO is shown to be more robust by achieving a 5.17% higher mean value in 10 trials while achieving the same maximum energy efficiency. The global optimum result is obtained under 20 mm/1.5 Hz condition and achieves an average energy efficiency of 59.07%. © 1996-2012 IEEE.",Digital twin; energy harvesting shock absorber; global optimization; K-fold swarm learning; mechatronics in road mobility; particle swarm optimization,Digital twin; Electromagnetic waves; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Global optimization; ISO Standards; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Shock absorbers; Swarm intelligence; Computational loads; Damping performance; Energy recovery; Global conditions; Learning frameworks; Local conditions; Local optimizations; Nearest neighborhood; Learning algorithms,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 2019CFB202, 51905394; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE: B17034","Manuscript received December 14, 2020; accepted January 27, 2021.

However, the impact of products on sustainability (environmental and social) across their life is often not considered and analyzed. IoT-based or smart products, that are able to communicate, generate data, which can be used to monitor and optimize sustainability indicators. The Digital Twin (DT) is a new technological concept which focuses on product individual data collection and analysis. It provides the possibility to make use of the available data and optimize the systems individual sustainability as well as future product generations. However, the design and realization of such a DT requires new approaches and capabilities, which is an identified research gap. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology to develop DTs of physical IoT-based products, the so called DT V-Model with the aim to optimize the systems sustainability, specifically environmental aspects. It is based on the V-model for the development of smart products and is enhanced with additional roles and approaches for DT development. The methodology is described in detail. The result of a development cycle according to the DT-V-Model is a tested concept of a DT, which includes Digital Master (DM) data from the planning phase and Digital Shadow (DS) data from the production, operation and End of Life-phase. For a DT for energy efficiency, the Digital Master model consists of the information and models from the product development phase including the planned production and use phase energy consumption. The Digital Shadow consists of the actual production energy consumption and the use phase energy consumption. The methodology is applied to a use case of an IoT-based consumer product that can be customized to a certain degree by the consumer. A DT is developed to monitor and optimize the products energy efficiency in production and use. The necessary elements of the DT and the capabilities are depicted. The paper shows the feasibility of the methodology for the development of DTs, the necessary adaptions to common approaches for development and the specific characteristics of DT development for the aim of energy efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

This study discusses a new energy efficiency‐related maintenance policy optimization method, which is based on failure data and status information from both the physical system and the digital twin‐based discrete event simulation. The study presents the functional model, the mathematical model and the solution algorithm. The maintenance optimization method proposed in this paper is made up of four main phases: computation of energy consumption based on the levelized cost of energy, computation of GHG emission, computation of value determination equations and application of the Howard’s policy iteration techniques. The approach was tested with a scenario analysis, where different electricity generation sources were taken into consideration. The computational results validated the optimization method and show that optimized maintenance policies can lead to an average of 38% cost reduction regarding energy consumption related costs. Practical implications of the proposed model and method regard the possibility of finding optimal maintenance policies that can affect the energy consumption and emissions from the operation and maintenance of manufacturing systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Although satisfactory energy efficiency and thermal performance can be achieved according to current appliances, in-depth discussion of system design and modeling is still necessary for providing mature applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of direct cooling system is presented, and essential components on the overall design are introduced as 4C chain (construction of the system, component modeling, cooling plate design, and coolant selection). Construction, coolant, cooling plate, and component modeling are presented independently for discussing the research progress, where detailed information is provided contributing to the selection of essential components. Moreover, the typical applications on electric vehicles of direct cooling are also investigated, and more productions are under research. Apart from system designing, the environmental fitness is also considered and the defects are summarized for system optimization. Considering to achieve future innovative application, digital twin model-based method is delivered for providing the guidance of prospective direct cooling system design, and the method enhances the potential to achieve better thermal management based on digital technologies and cloud-control platform. Based on the innovative development of cloud-controlling platform design and electronic and electrical architecture, the cloud battery controlling provides the chances for online elaborate model-based operation and precise model-based controlling strategy for novel direct cooling system. Novelty Statement: A comprehensive review on the general construction of system is presented, and essential components of direct cooling system are also summarized for optimizing the system efficiency. The article highlights the research profile of direct cooling system, namely 4C (construction of the system, component modeling, cooling plate design, and coolant selection) chain. Considering the future applications, the prospect of potential optimization is assumed for providing the guidance of future researched, and combination with digital twin models is one of probable methods where the results can be generalized to the battery thermal systems. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",coolant; direct cooling system; electric vehicle; lithium-ion battery; two-phase flow,Automobile cooling systems; Coolants; Digital twin; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Lithium-ion batteries; Systems analysis; Temperature control; Thermal management (electronics); Thermoelectric equipment; Controlling strategies; Digital technologies; Direct cooling systems; Electrical architecture; Future applications; System optimizations; Thermal management systems; Thermal Performance; Electronic cooling,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: U1864213; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2017YFB0102200","National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFB0102200; National Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: U1864213 Funding information",,,"Deng, H.; School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, China; email: denghuichao@buaa.edu.cn",,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,,,0363907X,,IJERD,,,,,,,,

The strategy considers the fluctuation of the wind power grid connection, the error of the prediction results and the efficiency of the energy storage equipment. Firstly, the Attention-GRU prediction model is established by introducing the Attention mechanism into the gated recurrent unit. Then, combined with the grid-connected power fluctuation standard and the response characteristics of different energy storage devices, the virtual variational mode decomposition (VVMD) is performed on the digital twin prediction data to obtain the primary distributed power. Finally, considering the limitations of the operating efficiency and service life of the energy storage equipment, the hybrid energy storage service system is used to modify the primary distributed power of the virtual hybrid energy storage to obtain the final distributed power. Experiments based on the wind power plant data in a certain area of Northeast China have verified that the strategy can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the wind power prediction, suppress the fluctuation of the wind power grid connection effectively, and enhance the utilization efficiency of the energy storage equipment. © 2021, Power System Technology Press.

This consumption continues to increase globally. Smart building proposals (focused on Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB), air quality monitoring, energy saving with thermal comfort, etc.) were already necessary before 2020, and the pandemic has made this research and development area more essential. Furthermore, the need to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and obtain technological solutions based on the Internet of Things (IoT) requires holistic contributions through real installations that serve as spaces for measuring, testing, study and research. This article proposes a “measure–analyse–decide and act” methodology to quantify the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) for university buildings as a reference environment for energy efficiency and COVID-19 prevention models. Two conceptual spaces (physical and digital) within two dimensions (users and infrastructures) are designated over an IoT three-level model (information acquisition, interoperable communication, and data-driven decision). An IoT ecosystem (sensoriZAR) was implemented as a proof-of-concept of a smart campus at the University of Zaragoza, Spain. Focused on CO2 and energy consumption monitoring, the results showed effectiveness through real installations, demonstrating the IoT potential as SDG-enabling technologies. These contributions allow not only experimental lab tests (from the authors’ expertise in several specialties of Industrial, Mechanical, Design, Thermal, Electrical, Electronic, Computer and Telecommunication Engineering) but also a reference model for direct application in academic works, research projects and institutional initiatives, extendable to professional environments, buildings and cities. © 2021 by the authors.

Optimising the residential energy consumption is a crucial step toward having greener and sustainable energy production. Such optimisation requires a household-centric energy management system as opposed to a one-rule-fits all approach. In this paper, we propose a data-driven multi-layer digital twin of the energy system that aims to mirror households’ actual energy consumption in the form of a household digital twin (HDT). When linked to the energy production digital twin (EDT), HDT empowers the household-centric energy optimisation model to achieve the desired efficiency in energy use. The model intends to improve the efficiency of energy production by flattening the daily energy demand levels. This is done by collaboratively reorganising the energy consumption patterns of residential homes to avoid peak demands whilst accommodating the resident needs and reducing their energy costs. Indeed, our system incorporates the first HDT model to gauge the impact of various modifications on the household energy bill and, subsequently, on energy production. The proposed energy system is applied to a real-world IoT dataset that spans over two years and covers seventeen households. Our conducted experiments show that the model effectively flattened the collective energy demand by 20.9% on synthetic data and 20.4% on a real dataset. At the same time, the average energy cost per household was reduced by 10.7% for the synthetic data and 17.7% for the real dataset. © 2021 by the authors.

The construction industry, which accounts for about 30% of the total energy consumption, needs to effectively manage and use renewable energy. The application of building information model (BIM) in the evaluation of retrofitting schemes of existing buildings is one of the main research issues in the field of building digital twins at present. The method of this research is to use 3D laser scanning technology to efficiently create the building energy model (BEM) of existing buildings and to identify and evaluate the feasibility of existing building retrofitting schemes. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the retrofitting scheme of existing buildings based on the concept of nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEBs), aiming to improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings and use clean energy to satisfy building energy demand.

Prior to simulation-based assessment, a baseline of savings for a set of utility-defined use cases was established to clarify the initial business case for specific energy efficient building technologies. In partnership with a municipal utility, 178,337 OpenStudio and EnergyPlus models of buildings in the utility’s 1400 km2 service area were created, simulated, and assessed with measures for quantifying energy, demand, cost, and emissions reductions of each building. The method of construction and assumptions behind these models is discussed, definitions of example measures are provided, and distribution of savings across the building stock is provided under a maximum technical adoption scenario. © 2020 by the authors.

The unpredictable network dynamics of aerial-assisted IoV pose challenges to the resource allocation. In this paper, dynamic digital twin (DT) of aerial-assisted IoV is established to capture the time-varying resource supply and demands, so that unified resource scheduling and allocation can be performed. We design a two-stage incentive mechanism for resource allocation based on Stackelberg game where DT of vehicles or road side units (RSUs) is deemed as the leader, and the RSUs who provide computing services are as the follower. In the first stage incentive, we determine the computing resources that RSUs are willing to offer according to vehicles&#x2019; preferences. To further maximize the satisfaction of vehicles and the overall energy efficiency, a distributed incentive mechanism based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is then designed, in which the resource allocation policy for each vehicle is optimized. Thanks to ADMM, the incentive mechanism can be run at multiple RSUs in parallel to reduce delay and relieve the computational burden of UAVs. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve the satisfaction of vehicles and the energy efficiency at the same time.

The project seeks to develop a production process framework for greenhouses, based on several case studies, that can be applied to different greenhouse facilities to enable a broad implementation in the industrial horticulture sector. The research will incorporate AI technology to support the production process agent in forecasting and learning optimal operating conditions within set parameters that will be feedback to the grower through a common information model. Furthermore, the production agent will communicate with other process agents to co-optimize the essential aspects of production. In turn, this allows the growers to optimize the production cost with minimal risk to product quality while aiding in upholding grid stability. The findings in this research project may be beneficial for developing industry-specific energy flexibility solutions incorporating product and process constraints. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Digital twin; Greenhouse; Industry 4.0; Multi-agent system,Application programs; Digital twin; Energy efficiency; Greenhouses; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; AI Technologies; Common information model; Energy efficient; Optimal operating conditions; Process constraints; Production cost; Production process; Specific energy; Ambient intelligence,,,,,,"This research is part of the Greenhouse Industry 4.0 funded by the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP).

This paper aims to develop a novel conceptual model for the implementation of blockchain technology (BCT) for digital twin(s) (DT) in the BECOM industry 4.0 to improve trust, cyber security, efficiencies, information management, information sharing, and sustainability. A PESTELS approach is used to review the literature and identify the key challenges affecting BCT adoption for the BECOM industry 4.0. A review of the technical literature on BCT combined with the findings from PESTELS analysis permitted researchers to identify the key technological factors affecting BCT adoption in the industry. This allowed offering a technological framework—namely, the decentralized digital twin cycle (DDTC)—that leverages BCT to address the key technological factors and to ultimately enhance trust, security, decentralization, efficiency, traceability, and transparency of information throughout projects’ lifecycles. The study also identifies the gaps in the integration of BCT with key technologies of industry 4.0, including the internet of things (IoT), building information modeling (BIM), and DT. The framework offered addresses key technological factors and narrows key gaps around network governance, scalability, decentralization, interoperability, energy efficiency, computational requirements, and BCT integration with IoT, BIM, and DT throughout projects’ lifecycles. The model also considers the regulatory aspect and the environmental aspect, and the circular economy (CE). The theoretical framework provides key technological building blocks for industry practitioners to develop the DDTC concept further and implement it through experimental works. Finally, the paper provides an industry-specific analysis and technological approach facilitating BCT adoption through DT to address the key challenges and improve sustainability for the BECOM industry 4.0. © 2021 by the authors.

A hardware controller and its digital twin are tested in real-time in a separate platform in the cloud, and the results are analyzed to determine what insights can tests on virtual controllers give about the behaviors of their real-life hardware counter-parts. Key performance indicators (KPIs) from literature are used to evaluate the control. It is shown that although the controllers differ in their control output time-series, their overall performance profile along the entire simulation run follows a similar pattern (KPI percent error varies between 3% and 8%). This implies that virtual controller testing can be a good indicator of hardware controller behavior. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Licence.",,Benchmarking; Energy efficiency; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Intelligent buildings; Synthetic apertures; Building automation; Building controls; Building operations; Cloud-based; Energy efficiency in buildings; Hardware counters; Hardware-in-the-loop testing; Key performance indicators; Real- time; Virtual controller; Controllers,,,,,"Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi: 03EN1014A","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy), promotional reference 03EN1014A.

Digitalisation is a strategy to increase the sector’s productivity, competitiveness, and efficiency. However, digitalisation also impacts environmental goals, such as those concerning more eco-friendly solutions, energy efficiency, products recycling, and sustainability certifications. These strategies rely on data, understood as digital, interoperable, incremental and traceable. Data related concepts, such as digital data templates (DDT) and digital building logbooks (DBL), contribute to “good data”. Despite some research focused on each one, little importance has yet been given to their combination. Relevant relationships and overlaps exist, as they partially share the exact same data through the built environment life cycle. This research aims to provide improved understanding on the role of these concepts and their contribution to a more circular industry. The review develops conceptualisations where DDT and DBL are complementary and framed within an incremental digital twin construction (DTC). Misconceptions or confrontations between these three solutions can therefore stand down, for the benefit of a data-driven priority. To increase understanding and reduce misconceptions, our study developed the “Digital data-driven concept” (D3c). This concept contribution is the ability to structure, store, and trace data, opening way to streamlined digital transformation impacting circular built environment concerns. © 2021 by the authors.

In this framework, advanced techniques, like Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), are utilized to create digital twins for historic buildings. A digital twin is a software representation of a physical object. This study uses digital twins to protect, predict, and optimize through analytics of real-time and historical data of selected features. Heterogeneous data of historic buildings, such as indoor environment, energy consumption metering, and outdoor climate, are collected with proper sensors or retrieved from other data sources. Then, these data are periodically uploaded and stored in the database of the cloud platform. Based on these data, AI models are trained through appropriate machine learning algorithms to monitor historic buildings, predict energy consumption, and control energy-consuming equipment autonomously to reach the balance of energy efficiency, building conservation, and human comfort. The cloud-based characteristic of our digitalization framework makes the digital twins developed in this study easy to be transplanted to many other historic buildings in Sweden and other countries. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Artificial Intelligence; Digital Twins; Energy Efficiency Optimization; Historic Buildings Preservation; Internet of Things,,,,,,,,,"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2010/31/2021-01-01, EUR-Lex-02010L0031-20210101-EN-EUR-Lex [Internet].

All specialised departments must work interdisciplinary during the design process in order to achieve an optimal result. In addition to the mechanical aspects, e.g., lightweight construction, the optimization of the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programs of tooling machines plays an increasingly important role. By optimizing the programs in terms of energy efficiency, the energy consumption of a machine can be significantly reduced. However, energy consumption depends on many parameters, so the optimization process is complex and a matter of all engineering disciplines working together. By using Digital Twins of tooling machines, simulations can be used to perform many parameter studies for optimizing energy consumption. However, the generation of Digital Twins of production systems is very expensive if they are to represent all relevant features of a production system. Through an IT system of networked software programs and using AutomationML as a special data interface these Digital Twins of machine tools can be generated automatically.

The fusion of two technologies can extremely accelerate the development of Industry 4.0 by enabling instant intelligence services. However, in the resource-constrained IIoT, the energy consumption of performing FL and maintaining the virtual object in the digital space by DT technology become the bottlenecks and can not be ignored. To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient FL framework for DT-enabled IIoT. In the proposed framework, IIoT devices choose different training methods considering dynamic time-varying environment status to achieve energy-efficient FL, i.e., either train locally or connect to the virtual object by DT in the corresponding server of a small base station (SBS) to train mapped data using computing resources of SBS. Then, we investigate the joint training method selection and resource allocation problem to minimize the energy consumption while satisfying the convergence rate of the training model. Considering the problem is intractable using traditional approaches, we use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results show that the proposed framework decreases greatly energy consumption compared with the static framework while satisfying the convergence rate of FL. © 2021 IEEE.",digital twin (DT); Energy efficiency; federated learning (FL); Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT),Deep learning; E-learning; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Reinforcement learning; Digital twin; Energy efficient; Energy-consumption; Federated learning; Industrial internet of thing; Intelligence services; Learning frameworks; Physical world; Training methods; Virtual objects; Energy efficiency,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 62001050; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality: L192033",This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China under Grant No. 62001050 and Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant No. L192033.,,"Stoyanova, M., Nikoloudakis, Y., Panagiotakis, S., Pallis, E., Markakis, E.K., A survey on the internet of things (iot) forensics: Challenges, approaches, and open issues (2020) IEEE Comm.

With the recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, Europe has made clear that improved schemes are required for more accurate assessment of the actual energy performance, exploring in a holistic approach the factors that affect both asset and operational rating. Towards that direction, a lot of research endeavours have been denoted in order to identify the additional information required and the necessary cutting-edge digital technologies that will not only enrich the energy performance certification process, but will at the same time facilitate and accelerate related procedures while also presenting more context to the users, raising understanding, awareness, and hence actual engagement. The D2EPC project presents a solution that covers the main current challenges and gaps in the assessment process, introducing a variety of improvements, in terms of information (e.g., energy, smart readiness, well-being, comfort, financial, and sustainability indicators) with the use of advanced tools (e.g., Building Information Modelling, Geographic Information Systems, etc.). The present work, introduces a high-level representation of the D2EPC architecture, elaborating on individual components and their interaction, towards delivering the envisioned final enriched web-platform that will enable dynamic Energy Performance Certificates based on (near) real-time field data. © 2021 University of Split, FESB.",Asset rating; Building information modelling; Certification; Digital twin; Energy performance; Geographic information systems; Operational rating,Architectural design; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information theory; Information use; Zero energy buildings; Asset rating; Building Information Modelling; Building stocks; Certification; Dynamic energy; Energy performance; Energy performance of buildings; Operational rating; Positive energy buildings; Zero energies; Energy efficiency,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 892984; Horizon 2020",This work is part of the D2EPC project that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 892984,ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is part of the D2EPC project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 892984.,"Climate Plan 2030, , https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/eu-climate-action/2030ctpen, accessed: 2021-05-21; Building Stock Characteristics, , https://ec.europa.eu/energy/eu-buildings-factsheets-topics-tree/building-stock-characteristicsen, accessed: 2021-05-21; Directive 2002/91/ec, , https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:001:0065:0071:EN:PDF, accessed: 2021-05-21; Directive 2010/31/eu, , https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celexn%3A32010L0031, accessed: 2021-05-21; Directive 2018/844/eu, , https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriservn%3AOJ.L.2018.156.01.0075.01.ENG, accessed: 2021-05-21; Renovation Wave, , https://ec.europa.eu/energy/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/renovation-waveen, accessed: 2021-05-21; (2021) Energy Efficiency-revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, , https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12910-Energy-efficiency-Revision-of-the-Energy-Performance-ofnn-Buildings-Directiveen; Fuerst, F., McAllister, P., Nanda, A., Wyatt, P., (2013) An Investigation of the Effect of Epc Ratings on House Prices; De Wilde, P., The gap between predicted and measured energy performance of buildings: A framework for investigation (2014) Automation in Construction, 41, pp. 40-49; Arcipowska, A., Anagnostopoulos, F., Mariottini, F., Kunkel, S., Energy performance certificates across the eu (2014) A Mapping of National Approaches, 60; Charef, R., Emmitt, S., Alaka, H., Fouchal, F., Building information modelling adoption in the European union: An overview (2019) Journal of Building Engineering, 25, p. 100777; Jenkins, D., Simpson, S., Peacock, A., Investigating the consistency and quality of epc ratings and assessments (2017) Energy, 138, pp. 480-489",,Solic P.Nizetic S.Rodrigues J.J.P.C.Rodrigues J.J.P.C.Gonzalez-de-Artaza D.L-de-I.Perkovic T.Catarinucci L.Patrono L.,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"6th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies, SpliTech 2021",8 September 2021 through 11 September 2021,,173101,,9.79E+12,,,,,,,,,

Ideally, the MPC algorithm should consider current- and planned usage of the controlled environment along with initial state and weather forecast to plan for optimal comfort and energy efficiency. This implies the need for an MPC application which 1) considers multiple objectives, 2) can draw on multiple data sources, and 3) provides an approach to effectively integrate against heterogeneous building automation systems to make the approach reusable across different installations. To this end, this paper presents a design and implementation of a framework for digital twins for buildings in which the controlled environments are represented as digital entities. In this framework, digital twins constitute parametrized models which are integrated into a generic control algorithm that uses data on weather forecasts, current- and planned occupancy as well as the current state of the controlled environment to perform MPC. This data is accessed through a generic data layer to enable uniform data access. This enables the framework to switch seamlessly between simulation and real-life applications and reduces the barrier towards reusing the application in a different control environment. We demonstrate an application of the digital twin framework on a case study at the University of Southern Denmark where a digital twin has been used to control heating and ventilation. From the case study, we observe that we can switch from rule-based control to model predictive control with no immediate adverse effects towards comfort or energy consumption. We also identify the potential for an increase in energy efficiency, as well as introduce the possibility of planning energy consumption against local electricity production or market conditions, while maintaining occupant comfort. © 2021, The Author(s).",Genetic algorithm;

The integration provides a new disruptive approach for vertical integration and optimization of the greenhouse production processes to improve energy efficiency, production throughput, and productivity without compromising product quality or sustainability. Applying the Industry 4.0 Digital Twin concept to the Danish horticulture greenhouse industry provides digital models for simulating and evaluating the physical greenhouse facility’s performance. A Digital Twin combines modeling, AI, and Big Data analytics with IoT and traditional sensor data from the production and cloud-based enterprise data to predict how the physical twin will perform under varying operational conditions. The Digital Twins support the co-optimization of the production schedule, energy consumption, and labor cost by considering influential factors, including production deadlines, quality grading, heating, artificial lighting, energy prices (gas and electricity), and weather forecasts. The ecosystem of digital twins extends the state-of-the-art by adopting a scalable distributed approach of “system of systems” that interconnects Digital Twins in a production facility. A collection of specialized Digital Twins are linked together to describe and simulate all aspects of the production chain, such as overall production capacity, energy consumption, delivery dates, and supply processes. The contribution of this project is to develop an ecosystem of digital twins that collectively capture the behavior of an industrial greenhouse facility. The ecosystem will enable the industrial greenhouse facilities to become increasingly active participants in the electricity grid. © 2021, The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence; Digital twin; Energy flexibility; Greenhouse; Industry 4.0,,,,,,64019–0018,"Based on the previous work presented in (Markvart et al. ; Sørensen et al. ), a national project called the Greenhouse Industry 4.0 (GHI4.0), funded by the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP Project no 64019–0018) with a project period of 2019 to 2022., aims to make the Danish horticultural greenhouse industry production energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable. GHI4.0 will enable energy-aware and sustainable production by adapting and combining the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) principal technologies; Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, cloud computing, and Digital Twins (DT) as integrated parts of their production systems. Similar to other energy and labor-intensive industries that compete with low-cost regions, such as cement production (Ma et al. ), the Danish horticultural greenhouse industry must continuously improve energy efficiency and production throughput, and productivity without compromising product quality or sustainability to stay competitive. The research presents a new disruptive approach for vertically integrating and optimizing the greenhouse production processes. Using DT technology, the Danish horticultural greenhouse industry will become increasingly competitive. Thereby securing their position against low-cost production regions globally, which are currently gaining access to the multi-billion global market for horticultural products. Furthermore, GHI4.0 will present a case study for assessing demand response potential while considering implications on the entire production chain. Hence, the project presents a novel way of considering demand response flexibility potential in terms of risk to production, aligned with the facility risk willingness. GHI4.0 will, in turn, enable the greenhouse facilities to become integrated consumers on the electricity grid that support the operation and stability of the future electricity grid (Clausen et al. ; Christensen et al. ).",The Greenhouse Industry 4.0 project is funded by the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP Project no 64019–0018).,"Afroz, Z., Shafiullah, G.M., Urmee, T., Higgins, G., Modeling techniques used in building HVAC control systems: a review (2018) Renew Sust Energ Rev, 83, pp. 64-84; (2017) Simulation Software Comparison, , https://www.anylogic.com/blog/simulation-software-tool-comparison/, Available from, Accessed 18 May 2021; Arendt, K., Jradi, M., Shaker, H.R., Veje, C., (2018) Comparative Analysis of White-, Gray- and Black-Box Models for Thermal Simulation of Indoor Environment: Teaching Building Case Study, , (a), ASHRAE; ModestPy: An open-source python tool for parameter estimation in functional mock-up units (2018) The 1St American Modelica Conference 2018: Modelica Association and Linköping University Electronic Press, , (b); Blum, D.H., Arendt, K., Rivalin, L., Piette, M.A., Wetter, M., Veje, C.T., Practical factors of envelope model setup and their effects on the performance of model predictive control for building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems (2019) Appl Energy, 236, pp. 410-425; Christensen, K., Ma, Z., Demazeau, Y., Jørgensen, B.N., Agent-based modeling of climate and electricity market impact on commercial greenhouse growers’ demand response adoption (2020) 2020 RIVF International Conference on Computing and Communication Technologies (RIVF); 2020 14–15 Oct, , (a); Christensen, K., Ma, Z., Demazeau, Y., Nørregaard Jørgensen, B., Agent-based modeling for optimizing CO2 reduction in commercial greenhouse production with the implicit demand response (2020) 6Th IEEJ International Workshop on Sensing, Actuation, Motion Control, and Optimization, SAMCON 2020; 2020-03-14; Tokyo, , https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03051658/file/CCI122%20%28submitted%29.pdf, (b); Clausen, A., Maersk-Moeller, H.M., Soerensen, J.C., Joergensen, B.N., Kjaer, K.H., Ottosen, C.O., Integrating commercial greenhouses in the smart grid with demand response based control of supplemental lighting (2015) 2015 International Conference on Industrial Technology and Management Science; 2015/11: Atlantis Press, , (a); Clausen, A., Maersk-Moeller, H.M., Soerensen, J.C., Joergensen, B.N., Kjaer, K.H., Ottosen, C.O., Integrating commercial greenhouses in the smart grid with demand response based control of supplemental lighting (2015) Acsr Adv Comput, 34, pp. 199-213; D’Addona, D.M., Ullah, A.M.M.S., Matarazzo, D., Tool-wear prediction and pattern-recognition using artificial neural network and DNA-based computing (2017) J Intell Manuf, 28 (6), pp. 1285-1301; Fisher, P.R., Heins, R.D., The greenhouse care system: a decision-support system for height control and scheduling of potted flowering plants (1996) Acta Hortic, 417, pp. 41-45; Frank, A.G., Dalenogare, L.S., Ayala, N.F., Industry 4.0 technologies: Implementation patterns in manufacturing companies (2019) Int J Prod Econ, 210, pp. 15-26; Frantz, J.M., Hand, B., Buckingham, L., Ghose, S., Virtual grower: software to calculate heating costs of greenhouse production in the United States (2010) Hort Technol, 20 (4), pp. 778-785; Haeri, H., Horkitz, K., Lee, H., Wang, J., Hardman, T., Ratcliffe, H., (2018) Assessment of Barriers to Demand Response in the northwest’s Public Power Sector, , Bonneville Power Administration; Herrmann, C., Thiede, S., Kara, S., Hesselbach, J., Energy oriented simulation of manufacturing systems – concept and application (2011) CIRP Ann, 60 (1), pp. 45-48; Holst, N., A universal simulator for ecological models (2013) Ecol Inform, 13, pp. 70-76; (2020) Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, p. 2020. , Oct., RIVF International Conference on Computing and Communication Technologies (RIVF), IEEE; Howard, D.A., Ma, Z., Jørgensen, B.N., (2021) Digital twin framework for energy efficient greenhouse industry 4.0.

The control scheme encapsulated motion control and control allocation by using a neural network, which was trained on a digital twin without having any prior knowledge of the system dynamics, using the Proximal Policy Optimization learning algorithm. By using a multivariate Gaussian reward function for rewarding small errors between the vessel and the various setpoints, while encouraging small actuator outputs, the proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning based control scheme showed good positioning performance while being energy efficient. Both simulations and model scale sea trials were carried out to demonstrate performance compared to traditional methods, and to evaluate the ability of neural networks trained in simulation to perform on real life systems. © 2021 The Authors",Deep Reinforcement Learning; Dynamic Positioning; Proximal policy optimization; Reward shaping,Dynamic positioning; Energy efficiency; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Control allocation; Control schemes; Implementation testing; Marine surface vessels; Neural-networks; Performance testing; Prior-knowledge; Proximal policy optimization; Reinforcement learnings; Reward shaping; Deep learning; algorithm; artificial neural network; computer simulation; machine learning; optimization; performance assessment; vessel,,,,,"Senter for Autonome Marine Operasjoner og Systemer, AMOS; Norges Forskningsråd: 223254","This paper is based on the work of a master’s thesis ( Øvereng, 2020 ) which was written in collaboration with DNV.

For energy-saving problem of discrete serial manufacturing system, the operation process of a digital twin based energy saving manufacturing system is proposed. In order to test interaction between physical and virtual system for energy efficient manufacturing, a digital twin simulator is established. In this simulator, a discrete event software is used to construct and imitate the operation of the physical manufacturing system, while the digital manufacturing system is build in MATLAB and used to control the operation of the physical manufacturing system. The production data are collected real time in the simulated physical system and transmitted to the digital system. Energy saving strategy and key indicator monitoring are implemented in the digital space. The generated energy saving command are sent to the mimetic manufacturing system of the physical space and the machines on/off states are controlled to save energy consumption. A case study is given to shown the real-time energy saving operation of discrete manufacturing system. © 2021 IEEE.",,Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; MATLAB; Simulators; Ecological environments; Emission reduction; Energy savings; Energy-saving control; Energy-savings; Physical systems; Real- time; Serial manufacturing; Time energy; World energies; Manufacture,,,,,,,,"(2019) BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019 (Report Style), , BP statistical review of world energy.

This trend has been adopted in some industries more than others. The design of equipment to handle granular or bulk material is commonly based on traditional approaches. Therefore, introducing mechatronic concepts in the design procedure can enable new possibilities, such as sensor integration and data analyses, adaptability and control. The efficiency of bulk material handling equipment in ports, agriculture and food processing is heavily influenced by the operational conditions. Typically, a piece of equipment is designed for defined operational conditions when the maximum performance can be achieved. In this work the concept of adaptability to varying operational conditions is explored by understanding the technologies implemented in other industries and the feasibility to be implemented in the bulk handling equipment design. Sensing technology, actuation and adaptability are systematically presented in this work to support the design process of the next generation of bulk handling equipment. This will pave the way for incorporating the technological trends in the design, such as: sustainability, 'smartness', Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, digital twin and machine learning. Adaptive mechatronic solutions will play a crucial role in generating and implementing innovative sustainable solutions for bulk handling equipment. © 2021 IEEE.",Adaptive design; Bulk material handling equipment;

Achieving this for new buildings is feasible, but it may be difficult to transform existing buildings to ZEBs. Digital twins provide a promising approach to monitor existing buildings and further increase their energy efficiency. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical entity. It has several applications in product design, product cycle, and fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines physics-based and machine learning methods to create a DT for the built environment. A case study for a digital twin of a single room is also discussed. The initial comparison of cooling energy between the physical testbed and the DT model shows promising results for future development. The limitations, challenges, and future development of the approach are also addressed in the paper. © 2021 Owner/Author.",building modeling; digital twin; hybrid models,Buildings; Digital twin; Energy efficiency; Fault detection; Learning systems; Product design; Smart power grids; Building construction; Built environment; Cooling energy; Hybrid approach; Machine learning methods; Physical testbeds; Virtual representations; Zero energy building (ZEB); Zero energy buildings,,,,,"Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society, CITRIS; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","This research was funded by the Republic of Singapore’s National Research Foundation through a grant to the Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore (BEARS) for the Singapore-Berkeley Building Efficiency and Sustainability in the Tropics (Sin-BerBEST) Program.

Due to their high digitization and controllable energy systems, the DCs can act as flexible assets, being able to dynamically adapt their energy profiles and valuable energy services. We present a flexibility management solution that is using a Digital Twin model of DC systems to determine action plans for shifting energy load. DC monitored data is acquired by integration with existing DC infrastructure management (DCIM) while energy predictions are computed for DC energy demand, energy flexibility, and heat generation. The flexibility optimization plans for DC operation are determined and enforced after DC manager validation via DCIM integration. Five energy services are identified as suitable to be provided by the DC with the help of described flexibility management solution: energy trading for increasing profit, grid congestion management by decreasing DC energy demand, scheduling by increasing DC energy demand to consume as much as possible the renewable available in the local grid, power factor compensation and sell heat on demand. © 2021 ACM.",Data Centers;

Taking into account non-distinct effect of tension on rolling process, the inter-stand tensions choice is a problem of multicriteria optimization with complicated on-line operation of digital twin. The relationships between tension level and technological parameters were obtained; they reflect well-known positive operating experience of different cold-rolling mills. Previously chosen tensions are assessed (taking into account restrictions of rolls retarding, strip bursting and non-flatness, and recommended based on the “tension level” characteristic. As a result of research on existing mills, dependencies were obtained to determine the rational values of the level of inter-stand tensions. An algorithm has been developed for assessing the cold rolling stability with allowance for tension. It allows to develop power-efficient technologies for production of cold-rolled strip with improved surface quality. © 2021, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

Since such processes should be carried out in parallel, it may result in bottlenecks in development and increased complexity. The trend for Digital Twins offers a promising option for the diagnosis and testing to be carried out separately from the physical devices, incl. autonomous vehicles in the virtual world. The idea of intercommunication between virtual and physical twins provides possibilities to estimate risks, drawbacks, physical damages to the vehicle’s drive systems, and the physical vehicleʼs critical conditions. Although providing communications between these systems arises at the speed that will be adequate to represent the physical vehicle in the virtual world correctly, it is still a trendy topic. This paper aims to demonstrate the enhancement of communications by using the Robot Operating System (ROS) as a middleware interface between two twinning systems by the example of the autonomous vehicleʼs propulsion drive. Data gathered from the physical and virtual worlds can be exchanged in the middle to allow for continuous training and optimization of the propulsion drive model, which would lead to more efficient path planning and energy-efficient drive of the autonomous vehicle itself. Additionally, a comparative analysis of ROS and its next version ROS2 is provided, discussing their differences and outlining drawbacks. © 2021 Authors.",Autonomous vehicles; Digital twins; Propulsion drives; ROS; Simulations,Automobile drivers; Autonomous vehicles; Digital devices; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Middleware; Motion planning; Propulsion; Remote control; Risk perception; Autonomous Vehicles; Condition; Drive simulation; Middle layer; Propulsion drives; Robot operating system; Simulation; Unity3d; Vehicle development; Virtual worlds; Virtual reality,,,,,"Eesti Teaduste Akadeemia; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 847577; Science Foundation Ireland, SFI: 16/RC/3918; Eesti Teadusagentuur, ETAg: PSG453; Tallinna Tehnikaülikool, TTÜ; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF: 2014-2","The research was supported by the Estonian Research Council under grant PSG453 “Digital Twin for Propul - sion Drive of Autonomous Electric Vehicle”.

The author draws a parallel between the Border Carbon Correction Mechanism and the early EU initiatives on carbon taxation of flights of foreign airlines operating in airports of EU countries. Recommendations are given to Russian metallurgical companies on possible measures to hedge risks associated with this EU initiative, including interaction with federal agencies to develop counteraction measures, as well as non-corporate measures of technological modernization using low-carbon solutions and compensation of corporate emissions based on ecosystem emission absorption projects. The possibility of blocking the EU initiative in the international arena, including the positions of the leading world powers on this issue, is analyzed.

Limited by the high network dynamics of the air-assisted IoV, resource allocation faces great challenges. In this paper, dynamic digital twin of air-assisted IoV is established to capture the time-varying resource supply and demands, so that unified resource scheduling and allocation can be performed. We designed an incentive mechanism for resource allocation based on Stackelberg games to maximize vehicle satisfaction and overall energy efficiency. In the game, the digital twin of air-assisted IoV within the coverage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are regarded as leaders, while RSUs that provide computing services are followers. At the same time, in order to reduce the delay and reduce the computational burden of the UAV, a distributed incentive mechanism based on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) was designed to optimize the resource allocation strategy of each RSU. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve the satisfaction of vehicles and the energy efficiency at the same time. © 2021 IEEE.",ADMM; Digital twin; Incentives; Internet of Vehicles; Stackelberg game,Antennas; Computer games; Energy efficiency; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Alternating direction multiplier method; Alternating directions; Communication connection; Incentive; Incentive mechanism; Internet of vehicle; Multipliers method; Resources allocation; Seamless communication; Stackelberg Games; Resource allocation,,,,,"B16037; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 824019","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 824019, in part by Special Funds for Central Universities Construction of World-Class Universities (Disciplines), and in part by China 111 Project (B16037).",,"Cheng, N., Quan, W., Shi, W., Wu, H., Ye, Q., Zhou, H., Zhuang, W., Bai, B., A comprehensive simulation platform for space-air-ground integrated network (2020) IEEE Wireless Communications, 27 (1), pp. 178-185; Lu, Y., Huang, X., Zhang, K., Maharjan, S., Zhang, Y., Low-latency federated learning and blockchain for edge association in digital twin empowered 6g networks (2020) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, p. 1; Lu, Y., Huang, X., Zhang, K., Maharjan, S., Zhang, Y., Communication-efficient federated learning and permissioned blockchain for digital twin edge networks (2020) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, p. 1; Dai, Y., Zhang, K., Maharjan, S., Zhang, Y., Deep reinforcement learning for stochastic computation offloading in digital twin networks (2020) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, p. 1; Gehrmann, C., Gunnarsson, M., A digital twin based industrial automation and control system security architecture (2020) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 16 (1), pp. 669-680; Sun, W., Lei, S., Wang, L., Liu, Z., Zhang, Y., Adaptive federated learning and digital twin for industrial internet of things (2020) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, p. 1; Liwang, M., Dai, S., Gao, Z., Du, X., Guizani, M., Dai, H., A computation offloading incentive mechanism with delay and cost constraints under 5G satellite-ground IoV architecture (2019) IEEE Wireless Communications, 26 (4), pp. 124-132; Zhou, Z., Liu, P., Feng, J., Zhang, Y., Mumtaz, S., Rodriguez, J., Computation resource allocation and task assignment optimization in vehicular fog computing: A contract-matching approach (2019) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 68 (4), pp. 3113-3125; Sun, W., Zhang, H., Wang, R., Zhang, Y., Reducing offloading latency for digital twin edge networks in 6G (2020) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology; Chai, H., Leng, S., Chen, Y., Zhang, K., A hierarchical blockchain-enabled federated learning algorithm for knowledge sharing in internet of vehicles (2020) IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, pp. 1-12; Zhou, Z., Dong, M., Ota, K., Wu, J., Sato, T., Energy efficiency and spectral efficiency tradeoff in device-to-device (D2D) communications (2014) IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, 3 (5), pp. 485-488; He, Y., Zhang, S., Tang, L., Ren, Y., Large scale resource allocation for the internet of things network based on ADMM (2020) IEEE Access, 8, pp. 57192-53203; Zheng, Z., Song, L., Han, Z., Bridge the gap between ADMM and Stackelberg game: Incentive mechanism design for big data networks (2017) IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 24 (2), pp. 191-195; Yu, Y., Bu, X., Yang, K., Wu, Z., Han, Z., Green large-scale fog computing resource allocation using joint benders decomposition, dinkelbach algorithm, admm, and branch-and-bound (2018) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 6 (3), pp. 4106-4117",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2021 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, WCNC 2021",29 March 2021 through 1 April 2021,,173967,15253511,9.78E+12,,,,,,,,,

As the engineering and education communities continue to adapt to the realities of a global pandemic, it is important to recognize the importance of the laboratory-based courses. In order to address to this situation, an ambitious approach is taken to recreate the laboratory experience entirely online with the help of the digital twins of the fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and turbomachinery laboratory experiments. Laboratory based undergraduate courses such as EFPLAB1, EFPLAB2 (Energy; Fluid and Process Laboratory 1 & 2) and EFPENG (Energy, Fluid and Process Engineering) are important parts of the ""mechanical engineering"" and ""energy systems engineering"" curricula of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences (HSLU) in Switzerland. Each course mentioned above include six different laboratory experiments about fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, turbomachinery, energy efficiency, and energy systems, including mass-and energy flow balances in energy systems. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it was necessary to adapt to the new environment of remote learning courses and modify the laboratory experiments so that they can be carried out online. The approach was developing digital twins of each laboratory experiment with web applications and providing an environment together with supporting videos and interactive problems so that the laboratory experiments can be carried out remotely. A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical system, e.g., the test rig. It may contain a collection of various digital models with related physical equations and solutions, information related to the operation of the test rig, including 2D or 3D models, process models, sensor data records, and documentation. Ideally, all quantities and attributes that could be measured or observed from the real experiment should be accessible from its digital twin. The digital twin not only reproduces the experimental setup in the laboratory but also helps to improve the knowledge related to the theory and concepts of the laboratory experiments. One major advantage of the digital twin is that the number and range of the parameters, which can be manipulated or varied, is larger in comparison to the actual testing in the laboratory. This paper explains the development of the digital twins (web applications) of the laboratory experiments and provides information about the selected experiments such as potential vortex, linear momentum equation, diffuser flow, radial compressor, fuel cell, and pump test rig with the measurement of pump characteristics. A remote or distance learning has many hurdles, one of the largest being how to teach hands-on laboratory courses outside of an actual laboratory. The experience at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences showed that teaching online labs using the digital twins of the laboratory experiments can work and the students can take part in remote laboratories that meet the learning outcomes and objectives as well as engage in scientific inquiry from a distance. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Reliable object detection and tracking is an important research issue in various WSN applications, such as environment and disaster monitoring, disaster propagation tracking, and intruder monitoring and tracking. Generally, because batteries are used as energy sources for sensors in WSNs, a highly energy-efficient operation is needed to prolong the life of the sensors and networks. To save energy, sensors usually manage multi-mode sensing operations, in which they periodically switch between active and inactive periods. A tradeoff exists between object detection accuracy and energy efficiency when we select a sensing schedule. Depending on the object speed, direction, and sensor deployment topology, different sensing schedules should be dynamically applied to individual sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based dynamic duty cycle control method for sensor nodes. For RNN training, a target optimal duty cycle for a given network condition is derived from the proposed digital twin-space analytic solution. Simulation results show that the proposed model provides accurate object detection performance and achieves high energy efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.",Duty cycle control; machine learning; object tracking; recurrent neural network; wireless sensor networks,Digital twin; Disasters; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Object detection; Object recognition; Object tracking; Sensor nodes; Energy efficient operations; Environmental monitoring system; High energy efficiency; Internet of Things (IOT); Monitoring and tracking; Object detection and tracking; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Recurrent neural networks,,,,,"Inha University, Inha",This work was supported by Inha University Research Grant.,,"Iqbal, A., Ullah, R., Anwar, H., Ur Rehman, A., Shah, K., Baig, A., Ali, S., Kwak, K.S., Wearable Internet-of-Things platform for human activity recognition and health care (2020) Int.

It is known that ventilation systems of such enterprises consume from 30 to 50 % of all electricity consumed for the mining process. In this regard, the proposed control models can be used to optimize energy costs and energy savings in ventilation. The Internet of things (IoT) InfluxData of stack TICK is offered for the realization. The offered architecture of cyber-physical system (CPS) consists of four subsystems: physical object subsystem, network and computing infrastructure IoT, digital twin, user interface. Architecture of CPS provides data processing from energy meters, control controllers and sensors of air environment parameters, implemented in blocks of on-line and off-line calculations. The digital twin of the ventilation system is made with the use of a time series database and a database of attributes that store information on changes in equipment parameters by time, air indicators, performance indicators, statistics on accidents and fan runtime, CPS characteristics, etc. CPS of the given architecture means connection of additional data sources, providing calculations of rational volumes of air delivery taking into account safety norms and requirements of energy efficiency. © Universidade Estadual Paulista, Fundacao Editora UNESP.",Cyber-physical system; Digital Twin; Energy saving; Internet of Things; Mine; Monitoring and control system; System architecture; Ventilation,,,,,,,,,"Lyalkina, G.

This paper presents an approach for implementing artificial intelligence (AI) in the concept of smart hydraulic press with regard to I4.0 technology. Conceptual solutions for greater system flexibility and improved blanket formability focus on designing a suitable concept for cyber-physical systems in combination with the digital twin. The main challenge is to develop a suitable AI-based algorithm in the manufacturing execution system (MES) so that the system is able to improve the forming process and avoid disturbances in real time. The concept of visualization and data analysis based on real-time monitoring of parameters of a smart hydraulic press is presented. With a continuous quality control of the products a more sophisticated system can be achieved. The main advantage to take into account in terms of hydraulics and Manufacturing as a Service (MaaS) are the new trends in energy efficiency of the systems and rapid automatic tool exchange. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Digital twin; Machine learning; Multi-Agent systems (MAS); On-line optimization; On-line simulation; Smart modelling,,,,,,"European Commission, EC; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Monbusho; Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS, ARRS; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Acknowledgment.

Despite the rapid development of China's heating industry, the overall efficiency of district heating systems is relatively low. In this paper, an innovative smart and transparent heating mode is proposed to solve the problems of the current heating mode. The proposed method integrates two core technologies: the 3D-GIS digital twin model and the NB-IoT wireless communication system. The concept, main characteristic of the proposed heating mode is discussed. A concrete technical scheme of the heating mode integrating the static and dynamic data of DHN is presented. To test the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed heating mode, two cases with a concrete implementation scheme are presented. The energy reduction rate, pump efficiency, and hydraulic imbalance level of proposed heating mode is compared with the traditional heating mode. Results show that the energy consumption of DHN under traditional set secondary-side supply target temperature control mode can be reduced by 26.11% compared with smart and transparent heating mode during the heating period. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",3D mapping; IIoT; machine self-learning; smart heating,Concretes; Digital twin; District heating; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; District heating system; Heated buildings; Hydraulic imbalances; Implementation scheme; Overall efficiency; Technical scheme; Traditional heating; Wireless communication system; Industrial internet of things (IIoT),,,,,Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation: 8172032,"Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 8172032 Funding information",,"(2019) China Statistical Yearbook, , Beijing, China Statistics Press; (2018) China District Heating White Paper Control Section, , Beijing, China Architecture and Building Press; Gong, M., Werner, S., An assessment of district heating research in China (2015) Renew Energy, 84, pp. 97-105; Lund, H., Werner, S., Wiltshire, R., 4th generation district heating (4GDH): Integrating smart thermal grids into future sustainable energy systems (2014) Energy, 68, pp. 1-11; Lund, H., Duic, N., Ostergaard, P.A., Mathiesen, B.V., Future district heating systems and technologies: on the role of smart energy systems and 4th generation district heating (2018) Energy, 165, pp. 614-619; Lund, H., Duic, N., Ostergaard, P.A., Mathiesen, B.V., Smart energy systems and 4th generation district heating (2016) Energy, 110, pp. 1-4; Mathiesen, B.V., Lund, H., Connolly, D., Smart energy systems for coherent 100% renewable energy and transport solutions (2015) Appl Energy, 145, pp. 139-154; Lund, H., Ostergaard, P.A., Connolly, D., Mathiesen, B.V., Smart energy and smart energy systems (2017) Energy, 137, pp. 556-565; Wang, N., You, S., Wang, Y., Hydraulic resistance identification and optimal pressure control of district heating network (2018) Energ Buildings, 170, pp. 83-94; Wang, Y., You, S., Zhang, H., Zheng, W., Zheng, X., Miao, Q., Hydraulic performance optimization of meshed district heating network with multiple heat sources (2017) Energy, 126, pp. 603-621; Qin, Y., Jiang, Y., Hydraulic optimization of multi heat source heating networks (2001) HVAC, 31, pp. 11-16; Qin, Y., Jiang, Y., Accessibility analysis of district heating networks (1999) HVAC, 29 (1), pp. 2-7; Yan, A., Zhao, J., An, Q., Zhao, Y., Li, H., Huang, Y.J., Hydraulic performance of a new district heating systems with distributed variable speed pumps (2013) Appl Energy, 112, pp. 876-885. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.06.031; Zheng, J., Zhou, Z., Zhao, J., Wang, J., Function method for dynamic temperature simulation of district heating network (2017) Appl Therm Eng, 123, pp. 682-688. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.05.083; Li, X., Li, W., Zhang, R., Jiang, T., Chen, H., Li, G., Collaborative scheduling and flexibility assessment of integrated electricity and district heating systems utilizing thermal inertia of district heating network and aggregated buildings (2020) Appl Energy, 258, p. 114021. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114021; Aberg, M., Do ground source heat pumps challenge the dominant position of district heating in the Swedish heating market?

In the first stage, an experimental investigation is carried out and a corresponding 1-D GT-Power simulation model is developed and validated by the experimental data for an Otto cycle engine and then modified into the Atkinson cycle engine. In the second stage, the digital twins engine model takes the spark timing, exhaust gas recirculation rate, intake variable valve timing, exhaust variable valve timing as well as lambda as the inputs of the simulation optimization platform for the Atkinson cycle engine. The optimum values of aforementioned input parameters are identified by the evolutionary non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to minimize the brake specific fuel consumption and nitric oxide under different speeds and loads, the reduction rates of fuel consumption and nitric oxide are decreased by up to 12.48% and 92.64%, respectively. In the third stage, the optimized performance MAPs are implemented in the series hybrid electric vehicle with the Atkinson cycle engine, the results show that the cumulative fuel consumption and nitric oxide volume fraction of the optimized vehicle under new European driving cycle reduced by 4.58% and 46.1%, respectively. It is concluded that the proposed evolutionary non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm method can identify the optimum conditions of vehicle well and improve its fuel economy as well as emission. Furthermore, the combined simulation platform for both engine and vehicle can be applied to evaluate and optimize the energy distribution and performance of vehicles with different technologies or strategies in the future.

This paper explores the use of an urban building energy model (UBEM) to examine the potential for creating a near-zero carbon neighbourhood in Dublin (Ireland) that is characterised by diverse land-uses and old and new building stock. UBEMs are a relatively new tool that allows the simulation of building energy demand across an urbanised landscape and can account for building layout, including the effects of overshadowing and the potential for facade retrofits and energy generation. In this research, a novel geographic database of buildings is created using archetypes, and the associated information on dimensions, fabric and energy systems is integrated into the Urban Modelling Interface (UMI). The model is used to simulate current and future energy demand based on climate change projections and to test scenarios that apply retrofits to the existing stock and that link proximate land-uses and land-covers. The latter allows a significant decoupling of the neighbourhood from an offsite electricity generation station with a high carbon output. The findings of this paper demonstrate that treating neighbourhoods as single energy entities rather than collections of individual sectors allows the development of bespoke carbon reducing scenarios that are geographically situated.

Therefore, economic growth should always go hand in hand with each industrial revolution. The medical industry, energy conservation and, in particular, production technologies will be transformed through new value chain models. Globalization, urbanization, demographic change and energy transformation are the transforming forces estimating the technological impetus for a better identification of solutions for a world on the move. In recent years, successive revolutions have made remarkable contributions to a person's quality of life, safety, industrial economy, comfort and health. This work aims at improving the energy consumption of buildings. To achieve this goal, we have created a Digital Twin that accurately reflects the behavior and characteristics of a future or existing building. To reproduce a copy of the future or existing building, we chose to use the Autodesk REVIT solution to meet several constraints. These have a significant influence on the energy behavior of the building. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The complexity of building energy management systems increases as they interface more and more subsystems and domains. As an important step to achieve a higher technology readiness level, these energy management systems need to be systematically tested in real-life conditions. Currently, there are no standard testing and experiment strategies in buildings to handle the mentioned complexity. Additionally, the levels of details reported in the existing experimental studies are heterogeneous. This paper summarizes an application of a holistic testing method to a flexible fully-equipped prosumer with the goal of facilitating test preparation, execution, replication, and comparison. Several empirical suggestions are provided, and a hybrid quantification strategy with digital twins is presented. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Licence.",,Energy management; Testing; Building energy management systems; Condition; High-technology; In-buildings; Level-of-detail; Low-carbon energy systems; Prosumer; Standard testing; Technology readiness levels; Testing method; Energy management systems,,,,,,,,"(2020) 2020 global status report for buildings and construction: Towards a zero-emission, efficient and resilient buildings and construction sector, , Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction, International Energy Agency, and United Nations Environment Programme; Gasser, J., Cai, H., Karagiannopoulos, S., Heer, P., Hug, G., Predictive energy management of residential buildings while self-reporting flexibility envelope (2021) Applied Energy, 288, p. 116653; Heussen, K., Steinbrink, C., Abdulhadi, I.

Thanks to IoT and AI, a static model evolves as a constantly updated system that is in connection with the real environment, thanks to data provided by sensors placed in it. In this paper the possibility of applying this system to complex infrastructures, such as port areas, is analysed. It has been chosen to apply it to a compact port area in order to be able to use this system, to investigate the different possibilities that it offers and to then be able to use it for larger port areas. The case study is located in the Ventotene Island, a small island located in the Tyrrhenian Sea, in front of the coast of central Italy, which is characterized by a considerable number of visitors during the summer season and a significantly reduced attendance during the rest of the year. It has been created an as-built digital model developed in BIM environment. It contains the architectural, structural and MEP models, both of port area and the building which is used for different services. Studies and simulations were carried out using the model, integrated with monitoring system to increase the security of the area. Finally, the model was connected to sensors installed in the real environment, obtaining the digital twin.

Those latter will comprehend several energy generators, traditional and/or from renewable energy sources (RESs), different energy storage systems using several energy vectors and that interconnect different energy-consuming sectors (power, thermal, transport sectors) and that fully exploit the potential synergies offered by such interconnected system. Nevertheless, since the first conceptualisation of digital twins in the first years of the 21st century, its use has not started yet for different reasons that are affecting the adoption of this game-changer approach. Hence, what are the main barriers that are holding back the adoption of digital twins in smart energy systems? The present review paper answers this research question while discussing the case studies that can be found in literature and analysing the different approaches and the system architectures that have been tested or simply idealised. This paper provides a basis for future research that aims at applying the digital twin concept in the energy sector and particularly for power grid management. It deals with the challenges of big data management, the ones related to real-time measurements and continuous communication between the real-world system and its digital twin, the investment for measuring systems, the issues connected with the use of large data centres and the correlated energy-related challenges and doubts. The review analyses the challenges that have been encountered so far, the proposed solutions and the opportunities that such a ‘work in progress’ topic offers. © 2021 WIT Press,",Barriers; Digital twin; Energy systems; Modelling; Real-time analyses,,,,,,,,,"Mai, T.T., Jadun, P., Logan, J.S., McMillan, C.A., Muratori, M., Steinberg, D.C., Vimmerstedt, L.J., Nelson, B., (2018) Electrification Futures Study: Scenarios of Electric Technology Adoption and Power Consumption for the United States, , https://doi.org/10.2172/1459351, United States: N; Philipp, G., Singaravel, S., Component-based machine learning for performance prediction in building design (2018) Applied Energy, 228, pp. 1439-1453. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.011; Grieves, M., Vickers, J., Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems (2017) Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Complex Systems, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-38756-7_4, Kahlen F.J., Flumerfelt, S., Alves, A.

Disruptive technologies have the potential to advance the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase in different application fields. With the increasing industry interest, there is a need to review the current status of research developments in FM. In this review, 70 journal articles published from 2011 to 2020 were reviewed. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the applications of disruptive technologies for FM, analyse research trends and identify research gaps and potential future research directions. This article focuses on only academic articles including topics, such as operations and maintenance, information management, emergency management and energy management. Eventually, it is hoped that this review will provide researchers with clarity of where research endeavours are most needed and helpful insights to address FM challenges. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Building information modelling (BIM); Digital twin (DT); Facilities management (FM); Literature review; Operation & maintenance (O&M),Frequency modulation; Information management; Maintenance; Risk management; Architecture engineering; Building information modeling; Digital twin; Disruptive technology; Facilities management; Facility management; Future research directions; Literature reviews; Operation & maintenance; Operations and maintenance; Architectural design,,,,,,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",,"What is FM - Definition of Facility Management https://www.ifma.org/about/what-is-facility-management, (Accessed 25 February 2020); Becerik-Gerber, B., Jazizadeh, F., Li, N., Calis, G., Application areas and data requirements for BIM-enabled facilities management (2012) J.

Digital twin (DT) and parallel intelligence (PI) techniques are ideal candidates to further advance the smart autonomous systems to the next level. The DTPI techniques are under fast deployments in both the energy and transportation sectors due to the inevitable transition from fossil fuel vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). The dramatic increase in EV charging demand yields a huge power supply gap. Currently, the low coverage and outdated management system of charging infrastructure have led to poor user experience and increased user range anxiety. To this end, we propose a cognitive charging station architecture for future charging infrastructure, which consists of power generation network, energy storage network, and charging network. DTPI techniques enable the cognitive charging stations to provide smart functions such as energy management, energy storage system health management, load management, intelligent maintenance, and smart user services. © 2021 IEEE.",Cognitive charging station; Digital twin; Parallel system,Charging (batteries); Fossil fuels; Charging infrastructures; Charging station; Cognitive charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Energy and transportation; Energy sector; Fast deployments; Fuel vehicles; Parallel system; Transportation sector; Energy storage,,,,,"Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG: TSP1020; National Research Foundation, NRF: 116309; University of Pretoria, UP","This study is supported by the South African National Research Foundation under the Grant No.: 116309, the UK Royal Academy of Engineering under the Grant No.: TSP1020, and the Research Development Programme from University of Pretoria.",,"Viola, J., Chen, Y., Digital twin enabled smart control engineering as an industrial ai: A new framework and case study (2020) 2020 2nd International Conference on Industrial Artificial Intelligence (IAI), pp. 1-6; Viola, J., Chen, Y., Wang, J., Information-based model discrimination for digital twin behavioral matching (2020) 2020 2nd International Conference on Industrial Artificial Intelligence (IAI), pp. 1-6; Wei, Q., Li, H., Wang, F.-Y., Parallel control for continuous-time linear systems: A case study (2020) IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 7 (4), pp. 919-928; Jun, Z., Xu, P.-D., Wang, F.-Y., Parallel systems and digital twins: A data-driven mathematical representation and computational framework (2020) Acta Automatica Sinica, 46 (7), p. 13461356; https://bnef.turtl.co/story/evo-2020/,2020, BloombergNEF Electric vehicle outlook 2020; Khaled, N., Pattel, B., Siddiqui, A., 6-digital twin model creation of solar panels (2020) Digital Twin Development and Deployment on the Cloud, pp. 137-162. , Academic Press; Khaled, N., Pattel, B., Siddiqui, A., 10-digital twin development and deployment for a wind turbine (2020) Digital Twin Development and Deployment on the Cloud, pp. 513-572. , Academic Press; Li, W., Rentemeister, M., Badeda, J., Jost, D., Schulte, D., Sauer, D.U., Digital twin for battery systems: Cloud battery management system with online state-of-charge and state-of-health estimation (2020) Journal of Energy Storage, 30, p. 101557; Qu, X., Song, Y., Liu, D., Cui, X., Peng, Y., Lithium-ion battery performance degradation evaluation in dynamic operating conditions based on a digital twin model (2020) Microelectronics Reliability, 114, p. 113857; Chinesta, F., Cueto, E., Abisset-Chavanne, E., Duval, J.L., Khaldi, F.E., Digital and hybrid twins: A new paradigm in data-based engineering and engineered data (2020) Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, 27, pp. 105-134; Milton, M., Ginn, C.D.L.O.H.L., Benigni, A., Controllerembeddable probabilistic real-time digital twins for power electronic converter diagnostics (2020) IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 35 (9), pp. 9850-9864; Woo, S., Bae, S., Moura, S.J., Pareto optimality in cost and service quality for an electric vehicle charging facility (2021) Applied Energy, 290, p. 116779; Onile, A.E., MacHlev, R., Petlenkov, E., Levron, Y., Belikov, J., Uses of the digital twins concept for energy services, intelligent recommendation systems, and demand side management: A review (2021) Energy Reports, 7, pp. 997-1015; Ikuzwe, A., Xia, X., Ye, X., Maintenance optimization incorporating lumen degradation failure for energy-efficient lighting retrofit projects (2020) Applied Energy, 267, p. 115003; Ikuzwe, A., Ye, X., Xia, X., Energy-maintenance optimization for retrofitted lighting system incorporating luminous flux degradation to enhance visual comfort (2020) Applied Energy, 261, p. 114379; Errandonea, I., Beltr'an, S., Arrizabalaga, S., Digital twin for maintenance: A literature review (2020) Computers in Industry, 123, p. 103316",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"1st IEEE International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence, DTPI 2021",15 July 2021 through 15 August 2021,,171890,,9.78E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In order to achieve optimal energy management of solar cars, it is necessary to comprehensively characterize the energy flow of vehicular components. To model these components which are hard to formulate, this study stim-ulates a solar car with the digital twin (DT) technology to accurately characterize energy. Based on the hybrid modeling approach combining mechanistic and data-driven technologies, the DT model of a solar car is established with a designed cloud platform server based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to realize data interaction between physical and virtual entities. The DT model is further modified by the offline optimization data of drive motors, and the energy consumption is evaluated with the DT system in the real-world experiment. Specifically, the energy consumption error between the experiment and simulation is less than 5.17%, which suggests that the established DT model can accurately stimulate energy consumption. Generally, this study lays the foundation for subsequent performance optimization research. © 2021 by the authors.

As a case study, an embedded control is integrated into the preliminary design of the ship power system, at the level of Energy Management System (EMS). The embedded control developed for the algorithm aims for cost, availability, safety and emissions optimization from the top layer. At the power system level, a few alternatives are considered such as full electric propulsion and fuel-based energy producers. Different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Key Exception Indicators (KEIs) and Key Improvement Indicators (KIIs) for design are evaluated for cost optimization purposes. Power plant sizing results of an Offshore Supply Vessel based on batteries or Generating Sets (GENSETs) power contribution are extracted with the proposed pro-clean power plant design algorithm structure. The result of this first simplified simulation not just include a comparative evaluation between 7 different types of batteries for an all electric ship sizing but also a maximum and instantaneous Depth of Discharge (DoD) of the batteries among the OSV load profile register which could be used as a control bandwidth to consider at the EMS level. The presented algorithm structure is a preface for later hybrid systems power plant sizing generalization. © 2021 IEEE.",,Availability; Battery management systems; Benchmarking; Digital integrated circuits; Digital twin; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electric power system control; Electric ship equipment; Energy management systems; Hybrid systems; Marine power plants; Offshore oil well production; Ship propulsion; Ships; All electric ships; Comparative evaluations; Depth of discharges; Integrated designs; Key performance indicators; Marine power systems; Preliminary design; Preliminary design phase; Offshore power plants,,,,,,,,"Brusso, B.C., A history of electric ship propulsion systems (2020) IEEE Industry Applications Magazine; Ghimire, P., Park, D., Karbalaye Zadeh, M., Thorstensen, J., Pedersen Shipboard, E., Electric power conversion: System architecture, applications, control, and challenges [technology leaders] (2019) IEEE Electrification Magazine, 7 (4); (2019) Assessment of Selected Alternative Fuels and Technologies, , DNV, DNV GL-Maritime; Othmanc, M., Praveen Reddya, N., Ghimirea, P., Karbalaye Zadeha, M., Anvari Moghaddamb, A., Guerrero, J.M., A hybrid power system laboratory: Testing electric and hybrid propulsion (2019) IEEE Electrification Magazine, 7 (4), pp. 89-97; Peralbo, F., Park, D., Zade, M., Smogeli, O., Jamt, L., Digital twin modelling of ship power and propulsion systems: Application of the open simulation platform (osp) (2018) IEEE 29th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE); Gaspar, H.M., (2018) Data-Driven Ship Design, COMPIT'18, , May; Bettayeb, M., Al-Saggaf, U.M., Practical model reduction techniques for power systems (1992) Electric Power Systems Research, 25 (3). , December; Leung, J., Kinnaert, M., Maun, J., Villella, F., Model reduction in power systems using a structure-preserving balanced truncation approach (2019) Electric Power Systems Research, 177. , December; Lu, L., Han, X., Li, J., Hua, J., Ouyang, M., A review on the key issues for lithium-ion battery management in electric vehicles (2013) Journal of Power Sources, 226, pp. 272-288; Se Sa, L.T.K., Mr, St, S., Va, Ep, Distributed co-simulation of maritime systems and operations (2018) Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering; Szelangiewicz, T., Zelazny, K., Prediction power propulsion of the ship at the stage of preliminary design, part i & II (2017) Management Systems in Production Engineering; Parizad, A., Reza Baghaee, H., Iranian Esmaeil, M., Gharehpetian, G.B., Guerrero, J.M., Real-time simulator and offline/online closed-loop test bed for power system modeling and development (2020) International Journal of Electrical Power Energy Systems, 122; Monti, A., Senior Member, I., Boroyevich, D., Senior Member, I., Cartes, D., Dougal, R., Senior Member, I., Wang, F., Ship power system control: A technology assessment (2005) Electric Ship Technologies Symposium; Mokashi, A., Wang, J., Vermar, A.K., A study of reliability-centred maintenance in maritime operations (2002) RePEc; Mohammadzadeh, N., Baldi, F., Boonen, E., Application of machine learning and mathematical programming in optimization of energy managment system for hybrid electric vessles having cyclic operations (2018) International Ship Control System Symposium; Bordin, C., Mo, O., Including power management strategies and load profiles in the mathematical optimization of energy storage sizing for fuel consumption reduction in maritime vessels (2019) Journal of Energy Storage, 23; Al-Falahi, A.M.D., Jayasinghe, G.S.D., Enshaei, H., Hybrid algorithm for optimal operation of hybrid energy systems in electric ferries (2019) Energy, 187; (2020) Energy Transition Outlook; (2018) Marine Power Solutions, , Caterpillar Review: May; (2021) Bunker Prices, , https://shipandbunker.com/prices, web accessed: March",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2021 IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference and Expo, ITEC 2021",21 June 2021 through 25 June 2021,,171191,,9.78E+12,,,English,"IEEE Transp.

For this, the architecture of a distributed forecasting information system is proposed that collects data from digital twins and provides them with a pre-trained neural network model to obtain forecasts about the need for predictive maintenance. The article discusses two types of forecasts - about the remaining useful life and the possible failure of an asset in the considered time window. Computational experiments have been carried out, confirming that the proposed neural network model allows, due to the simultaneous training of solving two problems, to obtain more accurate forecasts than models trained to solve one problem. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,Digital twin; Energy conservation; Energy management; Forecasting; Metropolitan area networks; Predictive maintenance; Asset maintenance management; Computational experiment; Neural network model; Remaining useful lives; Simultaneous training; Socio-economic systems; Socio-economics; Trained neural networks; Neural networks,,,,,,,,"Barkalov, S., Kurochka, P., Nasonova, T., (2018) Optimal Placement of Maintenance Facilities MATEC Web of Conferences Conference Proceedings, p. 01124; Zheng, C., Liu, W., Chen, B., Gao, D., Cheng, Y., Yang, Y., Peng, J., A data-driven approach for remaining useful life prediction of aircraft engines (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), pp. 184-189. , Maui, HI, USA, 4-7 November; Chen, Z., Cao, S., Mao, Z., Remaining useful life estimation of aircraft engines using a modified similarity and supporting vector machine (SVM) approach (2018) Energies, 11, p. 28; Ali, J.B., Chebel-Morello, B., Saidi, L., Malinowski, S., Accurate bearing remaining useful life prediction based on weibull distribution and artificial neural network (2014) Mech.

This approach allows to link the thermodynamic and mechanical model of a gas turbine with its control system while bypassing the necessity to model the electrical generator. A non-dimensional group, called Aergia number, has been experimentally correlated with the measured electrical power output through a linear function. The Aergia number reproduces with accuracy the electrical power output during both steady state and transient operation. Furthermore, the proven linearity of the model implies that, in principle, its implementation requires the knowledge of just two data points during steady state operation. The model has been validated using two experimental facilities within the ENEA Casaccia Research Center, each equipped with a Turbec T100 S3 micro gas turbine, but characterized by different gas paths. Furthermore, the same linearity relation has been confirmed for aeroderivative and heavy duty single-, dual-, and triple-shaft gas turbines with power outputs ranging from 2 to 330 MWel. In light of these findings, the non-dimensional group Aergia positions itself, at least, as a rule of thumb for evaluating gas turbine off-design power output and, on a broader perspective, as a valid performance indicator in the definition of a gas turbine digital twin. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Aergia number; energy management; gas turbine; micro gas turbine; power generation,Digital twin; Gases; Thermoelectric power; Electrical generators; Electrical power output; Experimental facilities; Innovative approaches; Micro gas turbines; Performance indicators; Steady state and transients; Steady-state operation; Gas turbines,,,,,,,,"Appun, K., German wholesale power prices turn negative less often in 2018, , https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-wholesale-power-prices-turn-negative-less-often-2018, 2019; Amelang, S., Appun, K., The causes and effects of negative power prices, , https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/why-power-prices-turn-negative, 2018; Pollitt, M., Kong, C.C., (2018) Europe's Electricity Market Design: 2030 and Beyond, Tech. rep., Centre on Regulation in Europe (CERRE), Brussels, Belgium; Denholm, P., O'Connell, M., Brinkman, G., Jorgenson, J., (2015) Overgeneration from solar energy in California: a field guide to the duck chart, Tech. rep., National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, USA; (2017) R&D Recommendation Report for the Next Generation of Gas Turbines, Tech. rep., ETN, Brussels, Belgium; Saravanamuttoo, H.I.H., Rogers, G.F.C., Cohen, H., Straznicky, P.V., (2009) Gas Turbine Theory, , 6th Edition, Pearson Prentice Hall, Harlow, England; New York, 2009; Walsh, P.P., Fletcher, P., (2004) Gas Turbine Performance, , 2nd ed., Oxford, UK, Wiley-Blackwell; Rowen, W.I., Simplified mathematical representations of heavy-duty gas turbines (1983) ASME J Eng Gas Turbine Power, 105 (1983), pp. 865-869; Rowen, W.I., Simplified mathematical representations of single shaft gas turbines in mechanical drive service.

The review reveals that: (1) nearly 70% of the reviewed studies focus on the operation and maintenance stage, and the most popular applications of CDT include energy management, facility operation and maintenance, and structural health monitoring; (2) not all studies present a complete CDT; and (3) the mechanisms to fuse different types of data for obtaining more credible decision-support information remain to be explored. © ASCE.",,,,,,,2020ACA006,This study is supported by the Hubei Province (2020ACA006).,,"Austin, M., Delgoshaei, P., Coelho, M., Heidarinejad, M., Architecting smart city digital twins: Combined semantic model and machine learning approach (2020) Journal of Management in Engineering, 36 (4), pp. 01-14; Boje, C., Guerriero, A., Kubicki, S., Rezgui, Y., Towards a semantic construction digital twin: Directions for future research (2020) Automation in Construction, 114, pp. 01-16; Chen, K., Lu, W., Peng, Y., Rowlinson, S., Huang, G.Q., Bridging BIM and building: From a literature review to an integrated conceptual framework (2015) International Journal of Project Management, 33 (6), pp. 1405-1416; Chen, L., Whyte, J., Analysing interdependencies of complex engineering systems using a digital twin-driven design structure matrix (2020) Construction Research Congress 2020: Computer Applications, pp. 417-426. , Reston, U.

A special intelligent product was proposed ten years ago, and this paradigm was named “communicating material”, i.e. materials equipped with micro components able to sense, store and communicate data. Communicating material needs a recursive architecture to be managed with a digital twin. A literature analysis is proposed concerning recursive multi-agent systems and architectures regarding communicating material applicability. The most promising reference architecture was adapted for modelling digital twin of a communicating material under energy constraint. The composition and decomposition mechanisms are detailed to improve energy performance by generating an aggregated product with a global view. An applicative scenario relative to the different aggregation modes between two communicating materials, illustrates the proposed architecture ability. © 2021 The Authors.

The surrogate-assisted strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SSPEA) is developed to optimize the power-split control parameters guided by the data from the physical PHEV and its digital twins. By introducing a ''confidence factor'', the SSPEA uses the fused data of physically measured and virtually simulated vehicle performances (energy consumption and remaining battery state-of-charge) to converge the optimization process. Gaussian noisy models are adopted to emulate the real vehicle system on the hardware-in-the-loop platform for experimental evaluation. The testing results suggest that the proposed SSPEA requires less R&amp;D costs than the model-free method that only uses the physical information, and more than 44.6% energy can be saved during the R&amp;D process. Driven by the SSPEA, the optimized energy management system surpasses other non-DT-assisted systems by saving more than 4.8% energy.

A higher automation level is required in order to maintain the stability and safe operation of the grid under high penetration of renewable energies and power electronic devices. In this sense, the DTs are an important part of this project, because they allow enhancing the system observability, capture systems dynamic and adapt the DT models according to changes and events in the real systems.

Underground mining enterprises (UEM) are energy-intensive and for them participation in such programs is especially relevant. The main consumer of electricity at UEM is the ventilation system, mainly the main fan unit (MFU). The article presents the DR service architecture at UEM, in which the basis for reducing power consumption at a given time is the prediction of the required performance of the MFU. Decrease in MFU performance can be planned (for example, during lowering and lifting of workers along he ventilation shaft) and unplanned. The paper presents the architecture of the DR service and considers the case of a possible unscheduled decrease in the MFU capacity based on the results of modeling the air distribution between the shafts in the digital twin with a predicted change in the parameters of the outside air entering the UEM. In the case of enabling such reduction, the energy management platform will be able to reduce the power consumption at a given time. © 2021 IEEE.",Demand Response; Digital Twin; Internet of Things; Load Forecasting; Mining Enterprise; Platform; System Architecture,Computer architecture; Electric power utilization; Green computing; Ventilation; Demand response; Enterprise IS; Load forecasting; Main fans; Mining enterprise; Performance; Platform; Services Architectures; Systems architecture; Underground mining; Internet of things,,,,,,"The research was financially supported by the Government of the Perm region as part of the project of the International Research Group ""Development of a digital model for forecasting and price-dependent demand response for electricity consumed by underground mining enterprises"", 2020.",,"Chasparis, G.C., Pichler, M., Spreitzhofer, J., Esterl, T., A cooperative demand-response framework for day-ahead optimization in battery pools (2019) Energy Informatics, 2, pp. 1-17; Xu, Y., Li, N., Low, S.H., Demand response with capacity constrained supply function bidding (2016) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 31 (2), pp. 1377-1394; Soares, L.J., Medeiros, M.C., Modeling and forecasting short-term electricity load: A comparison of methods with an application to Brazilian data (2008) Int.

However, manufacturing industries can only be achieved by combining the physical manufacturing world and digital world, to realize a series of smart manufacturing activities, such as active perception, real-time interaction, automatic processing, intelligent control, and real-time optimization, etc. In this paper, a digital twin-driven approach combines with agent-based decision-making for real-time optimization of motion planning in robotic cellular is proposed, with optimizing the physical and virtual layer at the manufacturing facility. Accordingly, an architecture of the digital twin-driven facility is design, and its operational mechanisms and implementation methods are explained in detail. Moreover, qualitative analysis and a quantitative comparison based on a real robotic cell are provided. Several key findings and observations are generated relating to managerial implications, which are valuable for various users to make manufacturing decisions under the digital twin-driven environment. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Digital twin; energy consumption; robotic cell; smart manufacturing,Cellular manufacturing; Decision making; Digital twin; Energy utilization; Flow control; Intelligent robots; Motion planning; Robotics; Agent-based decision making; Managerial implications; Manufacturing facility; Manufacturing industries; Operational mechanism; Quantitative comparison; Real time interactions; Real-time optimization; Robot programming,,,,,China Postdoctoral Science Foundation: 2018M633008; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province: 2018A0303130035,This work was supported by the [Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province] under Grant [2018A0303130035]; and [China Postdoctoral Science Foundation] under [2018M633008].,,"Abdulmalek, F.A., Rajgopal, J., Analyzing the Benefits of Lean Manufacturing and Value Stream Mapping via Simulation: A Process Sector Case Study (2007) International Journal of Production Economics, 107 (1), pp. 223-236; Barenji, A.V., Cloud-based Manufacturing Execution System: Case Study FMS (2018) International Journal of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 30 (4), pp. 449-467; Barenji, A.V., Barenji, R.V., Roudi, D., Hashemipour, M., A Dynamic Multi-agent-based Scheduling Approach for SMEs (2017) The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 89 (9-12), pp. 3123-3137; Barenji, A.V., Barenji, R.V., Hashemipour, M., Flexible Testing Platform for Employment of RFID-enabled Multi-agent System on Flexible Assembly Line (2016) Advances in Engineering Software, 91, pp. 1-11; Boschert, S., Rosen, R., Digital Twin—the Simulation Aspect (2016) Mechatronic Futures, pp. 59-74. , Springer, and,.

However, the industrial implementation of PEO has been hindered by a poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying plasma-assisted electrochemical coating formation. This study compares the characteristics of PEO processes on different valve metals in a dilute aqueous solution of NaOH and Na2SiO3 under pulsed unipolar and bipolar polarisation conditions. The focus is given to the influence of the nature of the valve metal on the transition to the soft sparking regime characterised by reduced energy consumption whilst yielding sintered coating materials enriched with crystalline phases. In-situ dynamic voltammetry analysis was employed to study the effects of the net current ratio and local negative charge injection using diagnostic pulses embedded in the polarisation signal. It has been demonstrated that soft sparking is a characteristic feature of valve metals such as Mg, Al, Zr and Ta that form insulating surface oxides with negligible electronic conductivity, whereas Ti and Nb form semiconducting oxides, which do not exhibit a characteristic voltage drop, although some features of spark softening were detected. This generalisation paves a way for implementation of a model known as ‘digital twin’ to the rational design of the PEO processes for deposition of the functional ceramics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",Breakdown; Coating; Passivity; Plasma electrolytic oxidation; Soft sparking; Valve metals,Ceramic coatings; Ceramic materials; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant coatings; Deposition; Electrolysis; Energy utilization; Optical properties; Oxidation; Polarization; Silicon compounds; Sodium hydroxide; Titanium oxides; Wear resistance; Breakdown; Eco-friendly technologies; Oxidation process; Oxide coating; Passivity; Plasma electrolytic oxidation; Rational design; Soft sparking; Valve metal; Wear and corrosion resistance; Metals,,,,,"EP/L01680X/1; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/S036180/1, EP/T024607/1","Financial support for research leading to this publication was provided by the UK EPSRC via ‘ NetworkPlus in Digitalised Surface Manufacturing ’ ( EP/S036180/1 ), Future Manufacturing System programme (project EP/T024607/1 , CoatIN) and The Materials for Demanding Environments Centre for Doctoral Training ( EP/L01680X/1 ) with support from BCW Manufacturing Group Ltd and is acknowledged with thanks.",,"Belevantsev, V.I., Terleeva, O.P., Markov, G.A., Shulepko, E.K., Slonova, A.I., Utkin, V.V., Microplasma electrochemical processes (1998) Protect.

Unlike the accelerometers and magnetometers, which are respectively sensitive to vibrations and ferrous materials interference, MEMS type gyroscope is able to provide stable orientation information for a short period of time. Compared with these two sensors, gyroscopes are neither disturbed by vibrations nor affected by metallic materials, and therefore it would be one of the primary sensors for industrial applications. Reviewing the most recently related works, accurate attitude estimations are usually obtained by fusing gyro integration. However, it is well known that series drifts will be induced after a long-term integration. Furthermore, according to the literature and the associated experiments, they all demonstrated that MEMS type gyroscopes have strong temperature correlation because of the silicon structure. Put it simply, the temperature variations will give rise to gyro drifts severely and thereby degrade the orientation estimation precision. To address this problem, this article proposed a temperature modeling technique and a real-time drift pre-compensation procedure by applying autoregressive moving average (ARMA) technology. Different from the traditional modeling methods, the proposed method is able to describe transient drifting behaviors as well as steady state ones. Moreover, comparison studies using artificial neural networks (ANNs) are also presented. Experiments show that the proposed method provides a stable and reliable temperature-caused gyroscope drift pre-compensation. The developed method is also very suitable for the realization in a low-cost embedded system. © 2020 IEEE.",autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model identification; MEMS gyroscope; temperature compensation,Autoregressive moving average model; Costs; Digital twin; Energy utilization; Gyroscopes; Neural networks; Autoregressive moving average; Inertial measurement unit; Low energy consumption; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Orientation estimation; Orientation information; Real-time compensations; Temperature correlation; MEMS,,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST: MOST 107-2221-E-006-114-MY3, MOST 108-2923-E-006-005-MY3","Manuscript received September 11, 2020; accepted September 24, 2020.

The operation of that system needs to be safe and efficient to avoid equipment damage and reduce energy consumption. The stable and secure operation of the equipment in a compression system is provided, many times, by a classical regulatory control layer. In this work, we present a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to provide setpoints for the regulatory control layer of a gas compression system, aiming to avoid excessive energy consumption, decrease the plant variability, and guarantee a stable and safe operation against load disturbances. The proposed method is tested in a digital twin of a typical industrial unit using a Dead-Time Compensator Generalized Predictive Controller (DTC-GPC). Some disturbances in the feed flow rate of gas were considered as case studies. The controller responded satisfactorily to these disturbances keeping the plant operation stable and returning the controlled variables in the desired operating range after a short time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Advanced process control; Compressor control; DTC-GPC; Gas compression system; Model predictive control; Time delay,Controllers; Delay control systems; Energy utilization; Gases; Predictive control systems; Time delay; Advanced Process Control; Compression system; Compressor controls; Control layers; Dead- time compensation; Dead-time compensator generalized predictive controller; Gas compression systems; Model-predictive control; Regulatory control; Time-delays; Model predictive control; compression; flow modeling; gas flow; numerical model; operations technology; regulatory approach,,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Petrobras","The authors acknowledge Petrobras (Petr?leo Brasileiro S.

The real-time and bidi-rectional feature of data interaction guarantees its advantages of high accuracy, real-time performance and scalability. In this paper the digital twin technology was introduced to electric vehicle energy consumption research. First, an energy consumption model of an electric vehicle of BAIC BJEV was established, then the model was optimized and verified through the energy consumption data of the drum test. Based on the data of the vehicle real-time monitoring platform, a digital twin model was built, and it was trained and updated by daily new data. Eventually it can be used to predict and verify the data of vehicle. In this way the prediction of energy consumption of vehicles can be achieved. © 2021 by the authors.

These technologies provide copious amounts of high-quality temporal data pertaining to indoor and outdoor environmental quality, comfort, and energy consumption. However, a barrier to their use in many applications is the lack of spatial context in the built environment. Adding Building Information Models (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to these temporal sources unleashes potential. We call this data convergence the Internet-of-Buildings or IoB. In this paper, a digital twin case study of data intersection from various systems is outlined. Initial insights are discussed for an experiment with 17 participants that focused on the collection of occupant subjective feedback to characterize indoor comfort. The results illustrate the ability to capture data from wearables in the context of a BIM data environment. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Licence.",,Architectural design; Environmental technology; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Internet of things; Wearable technology; Building Information Modelling; Energy-consumption; Environmental comfort; Environmental energy; Environmental quality; High quality; In-buildings; Spatial context; System building; Temporal Data; Energy utilization,,,,,,,,"Frontczak, M., Schiavon, S., Goins, J., Arens, E., Zhang, H., Wargocki, P., Quantitative relationships between occupant satisfaction and satisfaction aspects of indoor environmental quality and building design (2012) Indoor Air, 22 (2), pp. 119-131; Mills, E., Building commissioning: a golden opportunity for reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states (2011) Energ.

Intelligent rapid-excavation technology is a requirement of safe and efficient coal production, and a fundamental way to solve the imbalance problem between mining and development. The problems of tough operating environment, complicated geological conditions, multiple construction procedures and poor safety are presented in the coal mine roadway development in China. Intelligent excavation mainly faces three problems, such as the insufficient completeness, reliability and ability of stand-alone excavation equipment, the limitation of surrounding rock control technology and the lack of the efficient coordination of excavation process and the intelligent collaboration technology for excavating equipment groups. In order to solve the problem of insufficient intelligent excavation support technology, five kinds of intelligent excavation support technologies are put forward: the reliability of excavating equipment, the online perception of roadway surrounding rock state, the aging control of roadway surrounding rock, the efficient cutting with low specific energy consumption, and the comprehensive control of excavating dust. Based on the integration technology of excavation, support and transportation, the basic architecture of intelligent excavation system with four dimensions of ""edge perception, platform decision, equipment execution and remote operation and maintenance"" is proposed. Five key intelligent excavation technologies, including integration of excavation and exploration, automatic cutting, intelligent support, excavating navigation and remote centralized control, are analyzed and discussed. In order to expand the coverage of core technology support of intelligent excavation, according to different excavating equipment and different conditions of coal seam, four kinds of intelligent excavation modes, including the integration of excavation, support and transportation, full-section roadheader, roadheader with two bolter and continuous miner with 5G, are proposed, which have been popularized and applied in China National Energy Group, China Coal Group, Shandong Energy Group and Shaanxi Coal Group. Finally, the development direction and suggestion of intelligent roadway excavation are put forward. It is suggested to study the new technology of underground space positioning and navigation, the dynamic monitoring of protection effect and the accurate adjustment of support process, the robot with integrated mining and bolting, the high-precision intelligent perception and digital twin of roadway face, and the platform of excavation system. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of China Coal Society.

Web-based digital twin (WDT) has great potential for promoting sustainability in industrial cyber-physical systems. The current work demonstrates the mechanism by which a WDT architecture is established and utilised for improving sustainability. This is achieved by: a) accessing the control parameters that influence energy consumption, b) logging the energy consumption data and c) producing predictions by means of a computational algorithm. The objective is to support the system developer in delivering verified machine functionality along with trusted productivity and sustainability. The implementation is exemplified by an industrial case study adopted from a battery assembly production line. © 2021 IEEE.",Online technologies; Sustainability; Sustainable manufacturing; Web-based digital twin,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Sustainable development; Websites; Computational algorithm; Control parameters; Energy consumption datum; Industrial case study; Machine functionality; New business models; System developers; Web-based technologies; Digital twin,,,,,University of Warwick,"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Doctoral College at the University of Warwick, United Kingdom and the Integrated Manufacturing Logistics (IML) Catapult project.

Pairing BIM models to Building Energy Models allows designers to determine in advance the energy consumption of the building, improving sustainability of the construction. The challenge is to consider as many elements involved in the energy balance as possible and shuffling their parameters within a certain range. In this work, the automatic creation of a relevant set of design options to be analyzed for searching the optimum has been carried out. Firstly, the usual workflow that would be applied manually has been automatically followed by running scripts and codes, depending just on the initial setup given by the user. Although the procedure is very resource consuming, the main advancement relies in the reduction of the manual intervention and the possibility of creating large datasets of design options, avoiding gross errors. Secondly, Artificial Neural Networks and Transfer Learning techniques are applied to speed up the process of dataset creation. With such approach, the same dataset has been created, with about 30% of initial data and without significant loss of accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper proposes the extension of digital twin concept in such directions. First, we extend the digital twin with models of energy consumption, that allow the monitoring of production line components throughout production lifetime. Then, we propose a flow to design the communication network starting from information obtained from the digital twin concerning the production, usage and flowing of information through the plant. All these methodologies start from the production line specification, then they enrich it with data collected during operation, and finally information is used to perform design and optimization.

Firstly, the digital twin model of intelligent workshop was established as the only data source for workshop monitoring and surface roughness prediction; secondly, vibration signal was preprocessed and combined with power, energy consumption and cutting parameters to construct joint multi feature vector, and feature fusion was performed by principal component analysis; finally, support vector machine was used to predict surface roughness. The results showed that the average relative error was 4.00% and the maximum error was 0.07 μm, which verified the effectiveness of the method. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Digital twin; Multi-sensor; Prediction; Support vector machine; Surface roughness,Digital twin; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Machine tools; Manufacture; Support vector machines; Vibration analysis; Average relative error; Cutting parameters; Multi-sensor fusion; Normal machining; Real time performance; Roughness predictions; Sensor installation; Vibration signal; Surface roughness,,,,,"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM: 19511105200",Acknowledgements.

The existing approaches related to digital twins of AM mainly focus on the process, machine, and factory levels to monitor and optimize the process and system performance of AM. This study aims at the machine level and adopts augmented reality (AR) to develop a digital twin for a material extrusion printer. To provide a digital representation of the printing process of a component, this study has proposed an approach using cumulated small cylinders to approximate the geometry of the component, which is called “Volume Approximation by Cumulated Cylinders (VACCY)”. To monitor the economic and environmental performance, this study has modeled four process indicators (electricity use, manufacturing cost, greenhouse gas emission, and primary energy consumption) and integrated them in the AR-based digital twin. Through the test of the developed digital twin for printing three components, the feasibility and performance of the developed digital twin are well demonstrated. © 2021 The Authors",Additive manufacturing; Augmented reality; Digital twin; Material extrusion; Process monitoring,Additives; Cylinders (shapes); Energy utilization; Environmental management; Extrusion; Greenhouse gases; Printing presses; Process control; Process monitoring; Digital modeling; Economic and environmental performance; Machine level; Material extrusion; Model-based OPC; Physical systems; Process factory; Process machine; Process performance; Systems performance; 3D printers,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: 252408385- IRTG 2057",This study is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG German Research Foundation)- 252408385- IRTG 2057 .,,"Stark, R., Damerau, T., Digital twin (2014) Modelling in Cutting, pp. 1-8. , P.J.

In this paper, a data-driven connected corridor traffic simulation model, i.e., a digital twin, is developed that leverages real-time data streams to model the current traffic state and provide dynamic feedback on traffic and environmental performance measures, e.g., travel time, speed, energy consumption, and vehicular emissions. The developed digital twin model architecture uses real-time 6-min volume aggregate data and 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz signal indication data as input to simulate the connected corridor using a traffic modeling software microscopic simulation. Dynamic data retrieval and transfer from the simulation model are enabled using the software's COM feature and a Flask web server. The robustness and feasibility of the digital twin architecture and the generated performance measure reasonableness are demonstrated on a smart corridor test bed. Such a model can be used to monitor and provide insights on the impacts of intelligent transportation system technologies on connected corridor traffic and environmental performance. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Connected corridors; Digital twin; Intelligent transportation system (ITS); Real-time simulation; Smart city; Traffic simulation,Computer software; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Memory architecture; Smart city; Traffic control; Travel time; Connected corridor; Data driven; Environmental performance; Intelligent transportation system; Intelligent transportation systems; Performance measure; Realtime simulation (RTS); Simulation model; Traffic performance; Traffic simulations; Intelligent systems; computer simulation; data set; intelligent transportation system; numerical model; real time; smart city; traffic management; Varanidae,,,,,FC-9930,"The information, data, or work presented herein was funded in part by the City of Atlanta (CoA) and in part by the National Center for Sustainable Transportation (NCST) Dissertation Grant.

An energy storage planning method of Park energy system based on multi-dimensional digital twin technology is designed. This article explains the basic connotation of multi-dimensional digital twin technology and park energy system, and obtains feedback information. Combined with the energy consumption of industrial users, the park's electricity load is predicted. We used the multi-dimensional digital twin technology to construct the mathematical model of the equipment, extracted the energy conversion law, optimized the energy storage mode of the energy system, and achieved zero heat emission. Case analysis results: the average installed capacity of renewable energy after optimization is 2349.6 kW, 626.6 kW higher than that before optimization, indicating that the energy storage planning method integrating multidimensional digital twin technology has a broader application prospect. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

We study the integration of train regulation and train control by using deep learning and hybrid search methods. Specifically, a well-trained convolutional neural network is adopted to fit the nonlinear function mapping relationship between the input set (the line conditions and running time of the train in each section) and the output set (the energy consumption of the optimal speed profile and the switching points), which greatly reduces the calculation time of the optimal recommended speed profile in the process of train regulation. An integrated optimization model is proposed with the aim to minimize the total train delay and energy consumption, a hybrid search algorithm based on particle swarm optimization and a genetic algorithm was developed to solve the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified based on the actual operating data of a Beijing subway line. © 2021 IEEE.",,Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Genetic algorithms; Integration; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Subways; Convolutional neural network; Energy-consumption; Hybrid search; Metro system; Regulation and control; Regulation control; Search method; Speed profile; Train regulation; Trains control; Energy utilization,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61925302; 20210104","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.61925302, No.U1834211) and open research fund of The State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems (Contract No. 20210104). 1Z.

This has led manufacturers to find easier ways of meeting the demand. In doing so, manufactures have considered improving the production process and the time required for products to reach the end-user. The outbreak of Covid 19 also gave manufacturers more reasons to simplify the production process by manufacturing remotely. In this way, they could meet up with their customer demands without endangering the safety of their workers. This paper will be looking at using industry 4.0 to improve these processes and save more time b using Digital twin in implementing a smart factory. In this way, manufacturers will be able to improve production efficiency, while creating an environmentally friendly workplace for employees. In order to achieve this goal, it is significant to consider automating processes to save time and monitoring energy usage in factories to save energy.

In this paper, we addressed the critical challenges of DT construction and DT-assisted resource scheduling such as low accuracy, large iteration delay, and security threat. We propose a federated learning-based DT framework and present a Secure and lAtency-aware dIgital twin assisted resource scheduliNg algoriThm (SAINT). SAINT achieves low-latency, accurate, and secure DT by jointly optimizing the total iteration delay and loss function of DT, and leveraging abnormal model recognition (AMR). SAINT enables intelligent resource scheduling by using DT to improve the learning performance of deep Q-learning (DQN). SAINT supports access priority and energy consumption awareness due to the consideration of long-term constraints. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, SAINT has superior performance in cumulative iteration delay, DT loss function, energy consumption, and access priority deficit.

However, there are barriers in AM in terms of speed, working volumes, and need for post-processing. AM processes are typically optimized utilizing offline modelling and monitoring tools while real-time decision support and adaptiveness offered by Digital Twins are not yet fully achieved. The current work presents a digital-twin-supporting platform gathering existing knowledge and providing optimization services to potentially networked AM producers. Cycle time, energy consumption and connectivity to production planning are taken into consideration. Additionally, the extension of this methodology towards integration of empirical knowledge is demonstrated, utilizing dedicated testbeds. © 2021 The Author(s).",Additive Manufacturing; digital twins; efficient production; platform; process optimization,Additives; Decision support systems; Energy utilization; Optimization; Production control; Additive manufacturing process; Design and implementations; Efficient production; Manufacturing IS; Off-line monitoring; Offline models; Platform; Post-processing; Process optimisation; Working volume; 3D printers,,,,,EIT Manufacturing: A20134,"This research has been partially funded by EIT Manufacturing, under the 2020 activity “ACloud: Additive Enterprises Cloud Manufacturing and Networking”, A20134.",,"Stavropoulos, P., Foteinopoulos, P., Modelling of Additive Manufacturing Processes: A Review and Classification (2018) Manufacturing Review, 5 (2), pp. 8-34; Wohlers, T.T., Caffrey, T., (2015) Wohlers Report 2015. 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing State of the Industry Annual Worldwide Progress Report, , Fort Collins, Colo: Wohlers Associates; Bikas, H., Stavropoulos, P., Chryssolouris, G., Additive manufacturing methods and modelling approaches: A critical review (2016) Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 83, pp. 389-405; Florusse, L.B., (1992) Manufacturing Processes from An Industrial Management Viewpoint, Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 5 (4), pp. 269-275. , ISSN 0951-5240; Chryssolouris, G., (2006) Manufacturing Systems: Theory and Practice, , 2nd Edition; Bae, E.J., Jeong, I.D., Kim, W.C., Kim, J.H., A comparative study of additive and subtractive manufacturing for dental restorations (2017) The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry, 118 (2), pp. 187-193. , ISSN 0022-3913; Yoon, H., Lee, J., Kim, H., A comparison of energy consumption in bulk forming, subtractive, and additive processes: Review and case study (2014) Int.

By analyzing various studies along the life cycle of a wind power plant, the authors identified that Digital Twins are mostly applied within the operation phase of a wind power plant. CO2 reducing measures in this phase are investigated further on the basis of the two mediating variables: (1) decrease of high-carbon energy consumption and (2) increase of low-carbon energy production. Performing an explorative case study with industry experts, seven measures have been identified, which can be assigned to the two mediating variables.

Decarbonization requires a transformational shift in the way companies operate, how they source, use, consume and think about energy and feedstocks. If the Oil & Gas sector will continue to exist, it must carry out its activities in the safest possible way and digitalizing it will help in achieving this. A survey by Newsweek shows that areas where transformative technologies are having the biggest impact are production-related, operations and maintenance, enhanced recovery, fracking/tight reservoirs, and exploitation at greater depths. Luis Abril of Minsait opined that digital technology enables companies to extract more value from data, using new platforms to share data with the entire organization, suppliers, contractors, and partners. The real-time visualization of data helps optimize decision making. Big data can be analyzed to find answers to questions such as: What piece of equipment is showing signs of wear and should be replaced? What sort of predictive maintenance can be leveraged? What is the most effective fracking approach for this well? AI helps to reduce routine flaring, employ methane capture, optimize production and reservoir management using digital tools such as IoT sensors, digital twins, and virtual reality to model scenarios, monitor operations, track emissions, energy usage and proactively maintain equipment, produce lower-emission products by moving from one hydrocarbon to another (e.g., from coal to natural gas) or creating another product (such as biofuels or syngas). Transformative technologies, particularly IoT, mobility and cloud applications are going to have a profound effect on the future of the oil and gas sector. Investment in these technologies cost a lot which might be difficult for private companies, but it is worth the money in the long run.

Conceptually, a Digital Twin is a digital replica of a physical entity in the real world, and this technology is leveraged in this study to design a cooperative driving system at non-signalized intersections, allowing connected vehicles to cooperate with each other to cross intersections without any full stops. Within the proposed Digital Twin framework, an enhanced first-in-first-out slot reservation algorithm is proposed to schedule the sequence of crossing vehicles, a consensus motion control algorithm is proposed to calculate vehicles' referenced longitudinal motion, and a model-based motion estimation algorithm to tackle realistic issues of the vehicular communication, such as communication delay and packet loss. Additionally, an augmented reality human-machine-interface is designed to provide the guidance to the driver to cooperate with other connected vehicles, and an agent-based modeling and simulation of the proposed system is conducted in Unity game engine based on a real-world map in San Francisco. The human-in-the-loop simulation results prove the benefits of the proposed algorithms with 20% reduction in travel time and 23.7% reduction in energy consumption, respectively, when compared with traditional signalized intersections.

A vast amount of primary resources is spent during the construction of buildings, which uses 50% of raw materials taken from earth. The energy needed to heat, cool, illuminate, connect the fabric of the built environment contributes 36% to global energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions. At the same time, the building industry is one of the most fragmented, decen-tralized and diverse industries with nearly 3 million workers organized in 800.000 predominantly small enterprises. The vast spectrum of trades and sub-domains along with the diversity of its products ranging from residential buildings to tun-nels and bridges leads to a wide spectrum of information exchanged in temporary processes with fragile value chains. At the same time, the building sector as a whole is trailing in many productivity indices and in its state of digitalization. The potential to save energy and to contribute to the reduction of the car-bon footprint from the sector can be approached from a number of different angles: Improved design and planning for the few new and the many existing buildings; re-use and circular economy for the materials involved and synergetic effects through increased vertical and horizontal integration of processes, and subsystems. All this requires the integration of knowledge domains. 1.2 Semantic DTs in the Built Environment The individual cyberphysical sub-systems that comprise the built environment from individual buildings to vast and highly connected infrastructure networks including traffic, energy, water and waste networks, are designed, operated and maintained in completely separated, heterogeneous information silos with a very low rate of digitalization. Representing, monitoring, simulating and optimizing even of single nodes in these interconnected, multi-layered networks using dig-ital twins has only just begun. Within a single domain of these networks such as an individual building, a road-network or bridge, the current and past sys-tem states, their long-term monitoring and improvement requires comprehensive semantic models digital twin models. Such models are still in their infancy. Cur-rent and evolving information models are still mostly designed to capture static as-planned individual lifecycle stages, have bespoke and disparate insular solu-tions and little to no vertical and horizontal connectivity with other nodes in the network. Information exchange models for different aspects at various levels of granularity from geospatial superstructures (GIS) to building components (BIM) often have hundreds or even thousands of semantic entities and the sheer size of the structured vocabularies to describe products range in the tens of thousands of concepts which often differ on national or even regional levels. 1.3 Use cases and examples In the presentation an overview of ongoing research, development and standard-ization efforts regarding the creation, integration and interoperability of seman-tic Digital Twins for the built environment is provided. Concrete challenges and solution approaches of past and ongoing research from different use cases and application domains of Semantic Digital Twins for-the assessment and energy refurbishing of residential buildings-monitoring and predictive maintenance of bridges-road network interoperability with Linked Data across European borders are used to illustrate these challenges. These include the semantic lifting of legacy data models, the alignment and integration of vast domain vocabularies, multi-modal integration of heterogeneous status information (sensor, images, measure-ments) and ongoing efforts to create reference frameworks for semantically rich Digital Twins in the built environment.

Focusing on the built environment, the voluntary adoption of rating systems for sustainability assessment is growing, with an increasing market value, and is perceived as a social responsibility both by public administration and by private companies. This paper proposes a framework for shifting from a static sustainability assessment to a digital twin (DT)-based and Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled dynamic approach. This new approach allows for a real-time evaluation and control of a wide range of sustainability criteria with a usercentered point of view. A pilot building, namely, the eLUX lab cognitive building in the University of Brescia, was used to test the framework with some sample applications. The educational building accommodates the daily activities of the engineering students by constantly interacting with the sensorized asset monitoring indoor comfort and air quality conditions as well as the energy behavior of the building in order to optimize the trade-off with renewable energy production. The framework is the cornerstone of a methodology exploiting the digital twin approach to support the decision processes related to sustainability through the whole building’s life cycle. © 2021 by the authors.

Presently, its elaboration is driven primarily by cost reduction. Growth will, however, be fuelled by the consumption of various resources, bringing with it unavoidable losses and environmental, economic, and societal impacts. Additionally, strong deployment growth will be trailed by waste growth, which needs to be managed, to support Sustainable Development and Circular Economy (CE). A rigorous approach to quantifying the resource efficiency, circularity and sustainability of complex PV life cycles, and exploring opportunities for partially sustaining industry growth through the recovery of high-quality secondary resources is needed. We create a high-detail digital twin of a Silicon PV life cycle using process simulation. The scalable, predictive simulation model accounts for the system's non-linearities by incorporating the physical and thermochemical principles that govern processes down to the unit operation level. Neural network-based surrogate functions are subsequently used to analyse the system's response to variations in end-of-life and kerf recycling in terms of primary resource and power consumption, PV power generation capacity, and CO2 emission. Applying the second law of thermodynamics, opportunities for improving the sustainability of unit operations, the larger processes they are the building blocks of, and the system as a whole are pinpointed, and the technical limits of circularity highlighted. We show the significant effects changes in technology can have on the conclusions drawn from such analyses. © 2021",Circular Economy; Digital twin simulation; Exergy; Neural networks; Silicon photovoltaics,Cost reduction; Digital twin; Economic and social effects; Predictive analytics; Secondary recovery; Silicon; Sustainable development; Thermodynamics; Environmental footprints; Photovoltaic industry; Predictive simulation modeling; Process simulations; PV power generation; Resource efficiencies; Second Law of Thermodynamics; Silicon photovoltaic; Solar power generation; silicon; artificial neural network; carbon emission; computer simulation; ecological footprint; environmental economics; exergy; numerical model; photovoltaic system; power generation; silicon; sustainability; Article; artificial neural network; carbon footprint; energy consumption; energy cost; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; life cycle assessment; physical chemistry; process design; thermal analysis; thermodynamics,,"silicon, 7440-21-3",,,,,,"Abadías Llamas, A., Valero Delgado, A., Valero Capilla, A., Torres Cuadra, C., Hultgren, M., Peltomäki, M., Roine, A., Reuter, M.A., Simulation-based exergy, thermo-economic and environmental footprint analysis of primary copper production (2019) Miner.

APV systems symbiotically cohabitate power-generation facilities and agricultural production systems. In this work, solar power flow is rapidly computed with a reduced order model of Maxwell’s equations, based on a high-frequency decomposition of the irradiance into multiple rays, which are propagated forward in time to ascertain multiple reflections and absorption for various source-system configurations, varying multi-panel inclination, panel refractive indices, sizes, shapes, heights, ground refractive properties, etc. The method allows for a solar installation to be tested from multiple source directions quickly and uses a genomic-based Machine-Learning Algorithm to optimize the system. This is particularly useful for planning of complex next-generation solar farm systems involving bifacial (double-sided) panelling, which are capable of capturing ground albedo reflection, exemplified by APV systems. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results, with the overall goal being to provide a computational framework to rapidly design and deploy complex APV systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Agrophotovoltaics; Digital-twin; Machine-learning,Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Digital twin; E-learning; Electric load flow; Learning algorithms; Maxwell equations; Refractive index; Solar power plants; Agricultural production system; Computational framework; High frequency HF; Multi objective; Multiple reflections; Reduced order models; Refractive properties; Solar installation; Machine learning,,,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA: 2020-67021-32855","This work has been partially supported by the UC Berkeley College of Engineering and the USDA AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS), USDA award number 2020-67021-32855.",,"https://www.energy.gov/science-innovation/energy-sources/renewable-energy/solar; Goetzberger, A., Zastrow, A., On the coexistence of solar-energy conversion and plant cultivation (1982) Int J Solar Energy, 1 (1), pp. 55-69; Harshavardhan, D., Pearce Joshua, M., The potential of agrivoltaic systems (2016) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 54, pp. 299-308; Dupraz, C., Marrou, H., Talbot, G., Dufour, L., Nogier, A., Ferard, Y., Combining solar photovoltaic panels and food crops for optimizing land use: towards new agrivoltaic schemes (2011) Renew Energy, 36, pp. 2725-2732; Liu, W., Liu, L., Guan, G., Zhang, F., Li, M., Lv, H., Yao, P., Ingenhoff, J., A novel agricultural photovoltaic system based on solar spectrum separation (2018) Solar energy, 162, pp. 84-94. , (,),.

In this paper, an ultra-short-term prediction mechanism of photovoltaic power generation based on digital twin is proposed. By constructing digital twins, the real-time and high-precision photovoltaic power prediction is carried out. Firstly, a virtual model of photovoltaic power prediction is established based on the GA-BP neural network, and the twin data of the photovoltaic cells and the surrounding environment are collected with the multi-dimensional sensors, and the historical database is updated. Then, based on the collected twin data, the preliminary prediction results are obtained. Finally, through the similar weather condition searching, the actual power value and the predicted power values at those times under the similar conditions are found, and then the preliminary prediction results are modified to obtain the final predicted power. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively improve the ultra-short-term prediction accuracy of the photovoltaic power output. © 2021, Power System Technology Press.

The hydropower industry is turning to this technology with high expectations of obtaining high quality data to validate and calibrate numerical models that could be used as digital twins of key assets, further strengthening the sector’s relevant position within industry 4.0. Prior to any validation, fiber Bragg grating sensors’ ability to perform well underwater for long periods of time with minimal degradation, and their ease of scalability, drew the authors´ attention. A simplified modal analysis of a partially submerged beam is proposed here as a first step to validate the potential of this type of technology for hydropower applications. Fiber Bragg grating sensors are used to obtain the beam’s natural frequencies and to damp vibrations under different conditions. The results are compared with more established waterproof electric strain gauges and a laser vibrometer with good agreement. The presence of several sensors in a single fiber ensures high spatial resolution, fundamental to precisely determine vibration patterns, which is a main concern in this industry. In this work, the beam’s vibration patterns have been successfully captured under different excitations and conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

The exponential increase in the complexity of next‐generation wind turbines requires artificial intelligence (AI) to operate the machines efficiently and consistently. Evolving the current Industry 4.0 digital twin technology beyond a sole aid for the human decision‐making process, the digital twin in the proposed system is used for highly effective training of the AI through machine learning. Human intelligence (HI) is elevated to a supervisory level, in which high‐level decisions made through a human–machine interface break the autonomy, when needed. This paper also identifies and elaborates key enabling technologies (KETs) that are essential for realizing the proposed HCPS. © 2021 by the authors.

The paper discusses the advantages of using digital twins in the development of control systems and operation of distributed heat and electric power generation facilities. The possibilities of using the digital doubles for increasing the efficiency of the considered objects is presented as the example of optimizing the configuration of a control system of solar collectors in the presence of heat losses in pipelines of the external circuit. Further, the total balance consumed and generated electric and heat energy are presented. Examples of algorithms for protecting equipment to improve security are given, and the possibilities of improving the reliability of distributed power systems are considered. The system use of the digital twins provides the possibility of developing and debugging control algorithms, which increase the efficiency, reliability and safety of control objects, including distributed thermal and electrical power generation complexes. © 2021 Polish Academy of Sciences.

In reality, it is a decentralized wind power generation mode based on clean energy to replace the centralized large-scale traditional energy. In order to reduce computational complexity of massive DFIGs group in large power grid simulation, decentralized algorithm and architecture used in High-Performance Computing (HPC) are proposed and verified in this paper, which can batch automatic allocation of models to different computing units for parallel computing, and the fine-grained decoupling distributed parallel calculation method can effectively solve the exponential explosion of computing dimensions. The result waveforms under steady-state and three-phase fault transient conditions are basically consistent, which can meet the requirements of calculation accuracy, and also verified the efficiency of paper's work. © 2021 The Author",DFIG wind; Digital twin technology; Ecological Marxism; High performance computing technology,Cluster computing; Ecology; Electric fault currents; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Wind power; Centralised; DFIG wind; Digital twin technology; Doubly fed induction generators; Ecological marxism; High-performance computing technology; Large-scales; Marxisms; Performance computing; Technical models; Asynchronous generators,,,,,"19BKS009; Beijing Foreign Studies University, BFSU; Beijing Social Science Fund: 16KDC028; China Electric Power Research Institute, CEPRI","The research was supported by China National Social Science Fund Project ?Research on Ecological Thought in Capital from the Perspective of Life Community?

In the electric sector, power plants seek to adapt these new concepts to optimize electric power generation processes, as well as to reduce operating costs and unscheduled downtime intervals. In these plants, PID control strategies are commonly used in water cooling systems, which use fans to perform the thermal exchange between water and the ambient air. However, as the nonlinearities of these systems affect the performance of the drivers, sometimes a greater number of fans than necessary are activated to ensure water temperature control which, consequently, increases energy expenditure. In this work, our objective is to develop digital twins for a water cooling system with auxiliary equipment, in terms of the decision making of the operator, to determine the correct number of fans. This model was developed based on the algorithm of automatic extraction of fuzzy rules, derived from the SCADA of a power plant located in the capital of Paraíba, Brazil. The digital twins can update the fuzzy rules in the case of new events, such as steady-state operation, starting and stopping ramps, and instability. The results from experimental tests using data from 11 h of plant operations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed digital twin model. Furthermore, in all scenarios, the average percentage error was less than 5% and the average absolute temperature error was below 3◦C. © 2021 by the authors.

In the process of rapid development of wind power and solar power generation, environmental factors bring challenges that affect the safe operation of the systems while creating high operation and maintenance costs. This paper reviewed the lightning strike, icing, dust accumulation, encapsulation and intelligent operation and maintenance of power generation systems, summarized the research progress in China and abroad, and clarified five key issues to be solved as follows: lightning strike mechanism of rotating wind turbines under the influence of multiple climate factors, development of all-weather wind turbine blades adapting to complex environments, reliable encapsulation technology of perovskite solar cells with water and oxygen isolation, digital-twin based all-weather intelligent operation, and maintenance technology of wind power and solar generation equipment and zero CO2 emission recyclable technology of wind power and solar generation equipment. The effective solution of these problems will enhance the adaptability of wind power and solar generation system in complex environment, promote the safe operation of the new energy generation system, reduce the dependence on fossil energy with high CO2 emission, and contribute to achieving the goal of ""peak CO2 emissions and carbon neutrality"". © 2021, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

The gradual depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution issues require new renewable and eco-friendly power generation methods such as wave power plants. However, in wave power generation, which generates electricity by the energy of waves, it is criti-cal to understand and predict the amount of power generation and operational efficiency factors such as breakdown because these are closely related to highly variable wave ener-gy. Therefore, firstly, it is necessary to derive a meaningful correlation between highly volatile data such as wave height and sensor data in oscillating water column (OWC) chamber. Secondly, methodological study that can predict desired information should be conducted by learning the prediction situation with the extracted data based on the derived correlation. In this study, we design a workflow-based training model using a machine learning framework to predict the pressure of the OWC and verify the validity of pressure prediction analysis through the verification and evaluation dataset, using Internet of Things sensor data to enable smart operation and maintenance with the digital twin of the wave generation system. © 2021 ICIC International.",Big data; Machine learning; OWC; Pressure prediction model; Wave energy converter,,,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP: IITP-2020-0-01791; Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, KISTI","This research was supported by KISTI (Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information), and the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), the AI Grand ICT Research Center support program (IITP-2020-0-01791) supervised by the IITP (In-stitute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).","Acknowledgment.

This model describes the non-linearity and the thermoelectric behaviors of parameters such as transconductance (gm), on-state resistance (RdsON), threshold voltage (VGSth) and parasitic capacitances. The identification of these parameters constituting the behavioral model is based on supplier datasheets and complementary tests. This model can be used to anticipate short-circuit tests and it can be useful for the creation of a digital twin in order to refine the anticipation of reliability and understanding of solder ageing phenomena and bonding pull-out in power chips. With a 3D model and circuit approach, the variations of short-circuit currents once the component has aged can be observed during the impact of chip delamination and bonding pullout. © 2021 IEEE.",bonding pull out; delamination; electrothermal modeling; MOSFET SiC; short-circuit; simulation,3D modeling; Capacitance; Digital twin; Distributed power generation; Electric power system interconnection; MOSFET devices; Power electronics; Silicon carbide; Silicon compounds; Thermoelectricity; Threshold voltage; Timing circuits; Behavioral model; Circuit behaviors; Data sheets; Modeling and simulation methodologies; On-state resistance; Parasitic capacitance; Power chips; Short circuit tests; Predictive analytics,,,,,"101014935; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of V.

The model estimates the grid impedance seen by a distributed energy resource. The proposed algorithm has characteristics of passive and active islanding detection methods. Using a discrete state-space representation of a dq0 axis power system as equality constraints, a digital twin is optimized to match the power system of interest. The concept is to use the estimated grid impedance as the parameter to identify the difference between normal operation and islanding scenarios. Selecting arbitrary initial values, the digital twin approximates the response of the actual system and therefore a value for the system impedance. Results indicate that the proposed method has the potential to estimate the grid impedance at the point of common coupling. © 2021 IEEE.",distributed generation; IEEE Std 1547; islanding detection; Lagrange; optimization; renewable energy,Estimation; IEEE Standards; State space methods; Distributed Energy Resources; Grid impedance; IEEE std 1547; Islanding detection; Islanding detection methods; Lagrange; Model estimates; Optimisations; Power; Renewable energies; Distributed power generation,,,,,,,,"Ojetola, S.T., A real power injection control strategy for improving transient stability (2020) 2020 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM), pp. 1-5; Ojetola, S.T., Wold, J., Trudnowski, D.J., A multi-loop transient stability control via power modulation from energy storage device (2020) IEEE in Transactions on Power Systems, pp. 1-12; Darbali-Zamora, R., Evaluation of photovoltaic inverters under balanced and unbalanced voltage phase angle jump conditions (2020) 2020 47th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC), pp. 1562-1569; Aponte, E.E., Nelson, J.K., Time optimal load shedding for distributed power systems (2006) IEEE in Transactions on Power Systems, 21 (1), pp. 269-277. , Feb; Arguence, O., Cadoux, F., Raison, B., De Alvaro, L., Impact of power regulations on unwanted islanding detection (2018) IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 33 (10), pp. 8972-8981. , Oct; (2018) IEEE Standard for Interconnection and Interoperability of Distributed Energy Resources with Associated Electric Power Systems Interfaces, pp. 1-138. , IEEE Std 1547-2018; Yang, Y., Enjeti, P., Blaabjerg, F., Wang, H., Wide-scale adoption of photovoltaic energy: Grid code modifications are explored in the distribution grid (2015) IEEE Industry Applications Magazine, 21 (5), pp. 21-31. , Sept.-Oct; Pouryekta, A., Ramachandaramurthy, V.K., Mithulananthan, N., Arulampalam, A., Islanding detection and enhancement of microgrid performance (2018) IEEE Systems Journal, 12 (4), pp. 3131-3141. , Dec; Hoke, A.F., Nelson, A., Chakraborty, S., Bell, F., McCarty, M., An islanding detection test platform for multi-inverter islands using power hil (2018) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 65 (10), pp. 7944-7953. , Oct; Du, P., Ye, Z., Aponte, E.E., Nelson, J.K., Fan, L., Positive-feedback-based active anti-islanding schemes for inverter-based distributed generators: Basic principle, design guideline and performance analysis (2010) IEEE in Transactions on Power Electronics, 25 (12), pp. 2941-2948. , Dec; Desarden-Carrero, E., Darbali-Zamora, R., Aponte Bezares, E.E., Analysis of commonly used local anti-islanding protection methods in photovoltaic systems in light of the new ieee 1547-2018 standard requirements (2019) IEEE 46th Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC), pp. 2962-2969; Darbali-Zamora, R., Distribution feeder fault comparison utilizing a real-time power hardware-in-the-loop approach for photovoltaic system applications (2019) IEEE 46th Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC), pp. 2916-2922; Darbali-Zamora, R., State estimation-based der optimization for distribution voltage regulation in telemetry-sparse environment using a real-time digital twin (2021) MDPI Energies, pp. 1-20. , Jan 19; Grainger, J.J., Stevenson, W.D., (1994) Power System Analysis, , McGraw-Hill; Wood, A.J., Wollenberg, B.F., (1996) Power Generation, Operation, and Control, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Berrios Galarza, E., (2013) Mètodo de Detecciòn de Aislamiento Como Apoyo A la Generaciòn Distribuida, , Master's Thesis, University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez; Duncan Glover, J., Overbye, T., Sarma, M., Power system analysis & design (2017) Cengage Learning; Krause, P., Wasynczuk, O., Sudhoff, S., Pekarek, S., (2013) Analysis of Electric Machinery and Drive Systems, pp. 86-120. , John Wiley & Sons, Inc",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"48th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, PVSC 2021",20 June 2021 through 25 June 2021,,171495,1608371,9.78E+12,CRCND,,English,Conf Rec IEEE Photovoltaic Spec Conf,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115977256

Owing to the highly volatile nature of wave energy, the application of prediction techniques for power generation, failure diagnosis, and operational efficiency plays a key role in the successful operation of wave power plants (WPPs). To this end, we propose the following approaches: (i) deriving the correlation between highly volatile data such as wave height data and sensor data in an oscillating water column (OWC) chamber; (ii) development of an optimal training model capable of accurate prediction of the state of the wave energy converter (WEC) based on the collected sensor data. In this study, we developed a big data analysis system that can utilize the machine learning framework in KNIME (an open analysis platform), and to enable smart operation, we designed a training model using a digital twin of an OWC–WEC that is currently in operation. Using various machine learning models, the pressure of the OWC chamber was predicted, and the results obtained were tested and evaluated to confirm its validity. Furthermore, the prediction performance was comparatively analyzed, demonstrating the excellent performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM-based prediction model. © 2021 by the authors.

The methodology was based on digitalization analysis and numerical modeling as a preliminary stage. A mathematical model of the PV pumping installation considered the determi-nation of the characteristic equations for all its components. These have been used together with the SISIFO simulation software to achieve the performances of the mechanical and electrical components of an advanced PV pumping system. Its global performance features, namely the monthly energy yield, monthly pumping yield, and monthly total performances (energy and flow rate) were introduced. Digital platform (DP) for PV systems characterized by three advanced technolo-gies—machine learning (ML), digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) was developed. The simulation results were discussed for a specific case study conducted for a location in the Southern Romania regarding the irrigation potential, taking into account the main meteorological parame-ters: solar irradiance and ambient temperature, related to the site. The AI approach was imple-mented to achieve an optimum operation of the PV pumping system by the use of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method and the MATLAB/Simulink software. A unified development of all the components of the PV pumping system using the SISIFO simulation software was established by the authors, with major implications in the development of solar PV installations on large‐scale. © 2021 by the authors.

At present, the methods of the fault diagnosis of wind turbines are mostly based on traditional SCADA systems and big data analysis technology. The fault diagnosis process is complicated. Based on the current mature Internet technology, this paper introduces the concept of the Industrial Internet information model into the fault diagnosis of wind turbines and realizes the intelligentization of fault diagnosis of wind turbines. At the same time, the feasibility analysis of this scheme was carried out by studying the existing related cases. The results show that the information model has a stronger application prospect in the fault diagnosis of wind turbines. Compared with traditional methods, the new solution proposed in this paper makes the operation and maintenance and diagnosis of wind turbines more ideal. © 2021 ACM.",Digital Twin; Fault Diagnosis; Industrial Internet Information Model; Wind Turbine,Electric power generation; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Industrial research; Information theory; SCADA systems; Wind power; Energy structures; Fault diagnosis technology; Faults diagnosis; Industrial internet information model; Information Modeling; Internet information; Key equipment; Wind power generation; Wind power technology; Wind turbine faults; Wind turbines,,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2018YFB1700200",The work described in this paper was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1700200.,,"Kusiak, A., Li, W., The prediction and diagnosis of wind turbine faults[J] (2011) Renewable Energy, 36 (1), pp. 16-23; Batista, L., Badri, B., Sa Bourin, R., A classifier fusion system for bearing fault diagnosis[J] (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40 (17), pp. 6788-6797; Yongqian, L., Fei, W., Wengang, S., Operation condition classification method for wind turbine based on support vector machine[J] (2010) Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica, 9, pp. 1191-1197; Fei, T., Weiran, L., Jianhua, L., Digital twin and its potential application exploration[J] (2018) Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 24 (1), pp. 1-18; (2020) Industrial Internet Information Model White Paper, p. 4; Fei, T., Yin, C., Jiangfeng, C., Theories and technologies for cyberphysical fusion in digital twin shop-floor[J] (2017) Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 23 (8), pp. 1607-1609; Wei, Z., Jie, L., Analysis of platform of an offshore wind turbine (2017) International Journal of Electrical and Electronic Engineering & Telecommunications, 6 (3), pp. 7-10. , July; Dominik Ivo, D., Dhua, D., Huang, S., Wu, Q., Voltage support in hybrid AC-DC grid by wind power plants and VSC (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Electronic Engineering & Telecommunications, 7 (4), pp. 165-171. , October; Zaliskyi, M., Petrova, Y., Zaliskyi, M., Petrova, Y., Statistical data processing during wind generators operation (2019) International Journal of Electrical and Electronic Engineering & Telecommunications, 8 (1), pp. 33-38. , January; Chaerah Gunadin, I., Sanjaya Putra Az, E., Syam Akil, Y., Humena, S., The impact of the injection of wind power plant on the steady state condition and the dynamics of SULSELBAR power system (2019) International Journal of Electrical and Electronic Engineering & Telecommunications, 8 (6), pp. 327-333. , November; Ismail, F.B., Al-Muhsen, N.F.O., Ilham Noruddin, N., Design and development of dual power generation solar and windmill generator (2020) International Journal of Electrical and Electronic Engineering & Telecommunications, 9 (6), pp. 447-454. , November",,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Electronics Engineering, AIEE 2021",15 January 2021 through 17 January 2021,,174661,,9.78E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

That includes the pipeline structures for oil and gas industries or power generation plans and infrastructural transit systems. Prognostics and health management, along with Preventive, predictive, and prescriptive maintenance, are alternative options to avoid the failure in these systems by smart and on-time maintenance. However, although it is possible to collect data dynamically from these systems through their service periods, in many cases, a trustworthy and reliable knowledge base to allow making the right decisions is not always available. This paper presents the concept of LIVE Digital Twin that relies on four phases of Learn, Identify, Verify, Extend employing various Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) simulation strategies during the life span of the structure parallel to its design, performance, inspection, and maintenance. The architecture of LIVE Digital Twin is presented, and the details are described along with some practical case studies in Light Rail Transit (LRT) and pipeline systems in oil and gas industries. The presented concept and architecture of LIVE Digital Twin can be employed and implemented for various other applications and non-structural systems. © 2021 The Authors.

Dam safety analyses are fundamentally based on behavior models, which are idealizations of the dam-foundation that allow us to calculate the dam's response to a certain combination of actions. The comparison of this response with the real one, measured by the auscultation or survey devices, is the main element to determine the safety status of the structure. To improve this analysis, it is necessary to increase the accuracy of the numerical models obtaining a digital twin that allows knowing, in a faithful way, how the structure is going to work in normal and extreme situations. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",dams; dams security; digital twin; finite element method; instrumentation data; optimization,,,,,,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: RTC‐2016‐4859‐5","The research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness () through the project NUMA (RTC‐2016‐4859‐5).

The principles of its formation and use are proposed on the basis of a design database developed within the framework of a computer-aided design (CAD) system for thermal automation and measurements. Examples of design automation systems aimed at solving similar problems are given and the features of the proposed CAD system are indicated. The typical structure of the APCS and the relationship of its main components—sensors, cables, executive and switchboard devices, signal connection tables, as well as the software and hardware complex (composition and distribution of modules of communication devices with an object)—are described. A description of the project database’s structure is given, which provides comprehensive work with both project documentation and information about the main components of the APCS. The sequence in execution of design procedures and links between the design database and the CAD database during their implementation are shown. Methods for increasing the productivity of designers are considered, such as the use of standard solutions in the organization of measurements and control schemes for actuators of thermal power plants, multiple use of information with a single input, and synthesis of text and graphic design documentation based on the project database. It is proposed to use a digital twin at all stages of the object’s life cycle: during design, installation, commissioning, and operation. The effectiveness of working with information thanks to an intuitive interface for navigating through the project was demonstrated. Examples of objects, in the implementation of which the considered CAD system was used, are given. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",APCS; CAD; data model; databases; design; digital twin; digitalization; software and hardware complex; TPP; working documentation,Automation; Database systems; Digital twin; Life cycle; Thermoelectric power plants; Automated process control systems; Communication device; Computer aided design systems; Intuitive interfaces; Project documentation; Software and hardwares; Standard solutions; Thermal power plants; Computer aided design,,,,,,,,"(2017), p. 5. , http://digitenergy.ru/archive/energetics/transformation/; (2016) GE Digital Twin: Analytic Engine for the Digital Power Plant, , https://www.ge.com/digital/sites/default/files/download_assets/Digital-Twin-for-the-digital-power-plant-.pdf, (General Electric; Drozdova, T.V., Elov, N.E., Lebedev, A.A., Transition to digital power industry: The complex approach of Siemens (2018) Elektroenergiya.

This paper considers the problem of the development and application of a digital twin to assess cyberphysical systems. We analyze the details of digital twin applications at different lifecycle stages. The work reviews and summarizes properties of models concerning the digital and physical components of a cyberphysical system (CPS). The other issue of a CPS is increasing cybersecurity threat for objects, so special attention is paid to the heterogeneous digital twin usage scenarios to improve CPS cybersecurity. The article also details the heterogeneous digital twin’s implementation for a real upper-level control system of a nuclear power plant. The presented heterogeneous digital twin combines virtual machines with real equipment, namely hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) components. The achievements and drawbacks of the implemented model, including single timescale maintaining challenges, are discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

The reference for the validation process is a large-scale hydraulic installation equipped with a full-scale water vortex power plant prototype installed in Dresden (Germany), where flow field measurements were carried out using three-dimensional Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry. The numerical model was implemented within the software package Star-CCM+. The unsteady, two-phase flow was solved with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations in a Eulerian Multiphase approach, deploying a Volume of Fluid method to describe the free-surface flow. Water level and flow velocities were systematically compared in key areas of the device, demonstrating that the simulation is in good agreement with experimental observations. Relative differences are limited to at most 4% regarding water height in the system, and even the much more challenging velocity fields are reproduced with typical relative errors of roughly 10%. This validates the ability of the model to model the challenging flow conditions found in a water vortex power plant, enabling subsequent studies of the characteristics of this power plant concerning fish migration. © 2021 by the authors.

Even though much research and development has been performed in the field, there are several pitfalls and challenges towards dynamic district heating and cooling simulation for everyday use. This article presents the experiences from developing and working with a city-scale simulator of a district heating grid located in Luleå, Sweden. The grid model in the case study is a physics based white-box model, while consumer models are either data-driven black-box or gray-box models. The control system and operator models replicate the manual and automatic operation of the combined heat and power plant. Using the functional mock-up interface standard, a co-simulation environment integrates all the models. Further, the vali-dation of the simulator is discussed. Lessons learned from the project are presented along with future research directions, corresponding to identified gaps and challenges. © 2021 by the authors.

High volume fractions of solid fuel particles travel over the grate of a power plant, while heterogeneous reactions occure at the surface of the particles in combination with homogeneous combustion reactions inside the flue gas. Up to now, grate firing systems are still difficult to simulate with standard computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The movement of the solid particles inside the fuel bed and their heterogeneous reactions are difficult to combine with the homogeneous reactions of the gas phase species and the heat transfer. The emitted radiation from the gas has to be coupled with the heat balance inside the fuel bed. To solve this problem, we integrated a new library into a open source CFD code for coupling radiation models with the solids phase. We describe how to handle the workflow of the new library and present simulation results for two different furnace designs. An automatic mesh generator was developed. The work closes with simulation results for two different grate firing systems. Heterogeneous reactions and homogeneous reactions, as well as temperature fields inside the phase are presented. A validation of the simulations against measurement data is given. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",biomass; computational fluid dynamics; digital twin; grate firing system; OpenFOAM; waste,Computational fluid dynamics; Fuels; Gas dynamics; Heat transfer; Mesh generation; Open systems; Automatic mesh generators; Emitted radiation; Gas-phase species; Grate firing systems; Heterogeneous reactions; High volume fraction; Homogeneous combustion; Homogeneous reaction; Surface reactions; automation; combustion; computational fluid dynamics; design; heat balance; heat transfer; heterogeneity; model validation; multiphase flow,,,,,,We want to thank the Steinm?ller Babcock Environment GmbH for their support during development and implementation of the numerical model and Mr. M.

Experts make decisions for multiple operational objectives such as minimizing cost, maximizing productivity, ensuring compliance to environmental conditions, etc. However, deciding strategies to achieve an objective can be highly non-trivial as it may lead to conflicting outcomes concerning other objectives. Modern digital twin(DT) technologies make it possible to build systems to support such decision-making to validate critical decisions. DTs are developed as one-off solutions for individual plants in the current practice, requiring high efforts and domain knowledge. Our work demonstrates the use of a knowledge-driven approach to reduce DT development efforts significantly. The main contribution of our work is an end-to-end architecture that allows us to explicate, structure, and reuse domain knowledge to semi-automate DT development for industrial plants. We integrate technologies like semantic web, model-driven engineering, and formal methods to realize the architecture. Our approach to developing a DT supporting a fault management scenario in a power plant reduced 70% development time and 50% manual efforts. © 2021 IEEE.",digital twins; domain-knowledge; fault management; FMEA; knowledge-driven; state machines; transition system,,,,,,,,,"Skoldstam, M., Akesson, K., Fabian, M., Modeling of discrete event systems using finite automata with variables (2007) 2007 46th IEEE CDC.

However, many geothermal power plants could realize significant im-provements in operational efficiency from the application of improved modeling software. Increased integration of digital twins into geothermal operations will not only enable engineers to better understand the complex interplay of components in larger systems but will also enable enhanced exploration of the operational space with the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools. Such innovations in geothermal operational analysis have been deterred by several challenges, most notably, the challenge in applying idealized thermodynamic models to imperfect as‐built systems with constant degradation of nominal performance. This paper presents GOOML: a new framework for Geothermal Operational Optimization with Machine Learning. By taking a hybrid data‐driven thermodynamics approach, GOOML is able to accurately model the real‐world performance characteristics of as‐built geothermal systems. Further, GOOML can be readily integrated into the larger AI and ML ecosystem for true state‐of‐the‐art optimization. This modeling framework has already been applied to several geothermal power plants and has provided reasonably accurate results in all cases. Therefore, we expect that the GOOML framework can be applied to any geothermal power plant around the world. © 2021 by the authors.

However, as radiation levels increase, so too will the number of maintenance tasks that must be performed without human access. To meet these conflicting constraints, remote maintenance systems must therefore significantly increase their capabilities, performing tasks faster and in parallel. Unfortunately, the current teleoperation-based maintenance approach is inherently limited in these regards. Automation emerges as a potential solution, having demonstrated dramatic productivity gains in manufacturing across the world. The European DEMO project has begun to explore the feasibility of automated maintenance as a route to meeting the challenging availability targets. To this end, the Automated Inspection and Maintenance Test Unit (AIM-TU) has been designed and constructed, providing a highly versatile test platform able to adapt to evolving R&D programmes. It consists of a modular robot cell equipped with two robot arms mounted on linear rails, interchangeable end-of-arm-tooling, a variety of vision sensors and a fully integrated safety system. The hardware is supported by a modular software architecture, which permits different control input modes and provides a digital twin simulation of the cell for virtual verification and validation of control algorithms. This paper provides an overview of the system's capabilities and reports on the first automated maintenance feasibility tests performed on the cell: automatic replacement of JET reactor tiles and automatic contactless inspection of tile anomalies. © 2021 The Authors",Automation; Maintenance; Remote; Robotics,Computer software; Inspection; Maintenance; Plant shutdowns; Productivity; Automated inspection; Automated maintenance; Feasibility testing; Fusion power plant; Inspection and maintenance; Maintenance shutdowns; Maintenance tasks; Radiation levels; Remote; Test unit; Automation,,,,,633053,This work has been carried out within the framework of the EUROfusion Consortium and has received funding from the Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018 and 2019-2020 under grant agreement No 633053 .

This article describes the development of a digital twin for a cooling system based on data from the sensors of a thermal power plant. The digital twin created used data from a plant currently in operation at the major system, and the automatic rules extraction approach from the test database was used to form the model's knowledge database. The principal component analysis technique was used to reduce the dimensionality of the system to reduce the computational effort of the model. An algorithm for automatic update of rules during the operation of the digital twin was also proposed, making the model learn during the operation even without the need to retrain and, consequently, reduce error of the model's response in the short term. © 2021 IEEE",Cooling system; Digital twin; Fuzzy system; PCA; Thermal power plant,Cooling systems; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectric power plants; Automatic updates; Computational effort; Enabling technologies; Error of the models; Knowledge database; Real physical systems; Technological advances; Thermal power plants; Digital twin,,,,,,,,"de Almeida, C., Maciel, V., Cybis, L., Global warming potential assessment for operation of thermoelectric power plant in Manaus (2017) Revista Latinoamericana En Análisis de Ciclo de Vida Latin-American Life Cycle Assessment Journal, p. 44; ONS - Histórico DA OPERAÇÃO, , http://www.ons.org.br/Paginas/resultados-da-operacao/historicoda-operacao/geracao_energia.aspx, Available in:< >.

Much of the literature at this time is dedicated to the conceptualization of digital twins, and associated enabling technologies and challenges. In this paper, we consider these propositions for the specific application of nuclear power. Our review finds that the current DT concepts are amenable to nuclear power systems, but benefit from some modifications and enhancements. Further, some areas of the existing modeling and simulation infrastructure around nuclear power systems are adaptable to DT development, while more recent efforts in advanced modeling and simulation are less suitable at this time. For nuclear power applications, DT development should rely first on mechanistic model-based methods to leverage the extensive experience and understanding of these systems. Model-free techniques can then be adopted to selectively, and correctively, augment limitations in the model-based approaches. Challenges to the realization of a DT are also discussed, with some being unique to nuclear engineering, however most are broader. A challenging aspect we discuss in detail for DTs is the incorporation of uncertainty quantification (UQ). Forward UQ enables the propagation of uncertainty from the digital representations to predict behavior of the physical asset. Similarly, inverse UQ allows for the incorporation of data from new measurements obtained from the physical asset back into the DT. Optimization under uncertainty facilitates decision support through the formal methods of optimal experimental design and design optimization that maximize information gain, or performance, of the physical asset in an uncertain environment. © 2021 by the authors.

In this context, a logistical simulation tool has been developed to quantitatively evaluate and compare different reactor and maintenance concepts within the DEMO project. The overall goal is to support the decision-making process during both the design and operation phase of the fusion power plant. Increasing the quality and consistency of the input data is necessary to be able to derive credible information from the simulation results to support the design and decision-making process. Such computational models – especially within complex systems like fusion power plants – require validation in form of a connection to the real world. With ongoing project progress more and more credible data will be available that can be integrated in the tool to refine and validate the results. In the future the tool can be part of a digital twin where the real-world is linked to a virtual environment along the life-cycle of a fusion power plant. Coming from a pre-operational simulation tool, predicting the maintenance duration to support design decisions, the tool may support maintenance control in later operations phase, based on physical data in real time. It is discussed how the tool should be further developed as the DEMO project progresses and how it can be adapted to the requirements of the respective project phases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Decision support; DEMO maintenance logistics modelling tool; Development cycle; Digital twin; Modularity; Simulation,Decision making; Fusion reactions; Life cycle; Maintenance; Virtual reality; Decision supports; Decision-making process; DEMO maintenance logistic modeling tool; Development cycle; Fusion power plant; Modularity; Operation phase; Project progress; Real-world; Simulation; Decision support systems,,,,,H2020 Euratom: 633053,This work has been carried out within the framework of the EUROfusion Consortium and has received funding from the Euratom research and training programme 2014?2018 and 2019?2020 under grant agreement No. 633053.

A general extension of primary/secondary reserves is necessary to cope with the increasing penetration of stochastic renewable energies and maintain the grid vulnerability at acceptable levels. In this context, hydropower plants are called upon to play a major role due to their operational flexibility and ability to provide ancillary services. However, the provision of these services is not without consequences for the plant, as the increase of load variations and start/stop sequences enhances fatigue problems by soliciting the penstocks faster than originally expected. Given that the fatigue wear rate can be 10x higher when ancillary services are active, it is crucial to ensure the fitness-for-service of the penstocks by proper monitoring. Nevertheless, the number of sensors along the hydraulic circuit is often very limited, so that periodic stops of the plant and inspections are necessary to assess the health of the pipes. In this paper, we present how a digital twin of the power plant, namely the Hydro-Clone system, can be used to fill this gap by enabling real-time knowledge of the transient pressures throughout the water conduits. These pressures are correlated to the stress variations using either analytical formula or finite element modelling (FEM), depending on the geometry and embedding conditions of each penstock element. The validity of this approach is demonstrated by comparing the predicted stresses with measured values in the penstock of the 200 MW La B tiaz hydropower plant, owned by Electricité d'Emosson SA. To this end, strain gages are mounted at the bottom and top of the penstock, in front of the manifold and on the penstock protection valve. The appropriate conversion of pressure to stress at the strain gage location is derived through the analysis of FEM simulations. This work shows the benefits of using a digital twin for fatigue assessment and paves the way for real-time penstocks fatigue monitoring. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Digital twin; Fatigue of materials; Finite element method; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Hydroelectric power; Penstocks; Stochastic systems; Strain gages; Analytical formulas; Electricity production; Fatigue assessments; Finite element modelling; Fitness for service; Operational flexibility; Renewable energies; Transient pressures; Hydroelectric power plants,,,,,"Innosuisse - Schweizerische Agentur für Innovationsförderung, Innosuisse",The present study was performed within the framework of the CTI project n° 28112.1 PFIW-IW “Penstock Fatigue Monitoring”.

Herein, a unified AMI system across security zones was designed, which used the digital twin auxiliary information system as a supporting system to simulate a multi-service data model. With the comprehensive analysis of the digital twin auxiliary information system to the running results from the model, the collection system could grasp the needs of the application system in real time, thereby dynamically adjusting collection frequency. Furthermore, field running test on this system was carried out in the Measurement Center of Shenzhen Power Supply Bureau, and it verified that the system had the ability to collect data in seconds. the simulation results were analyzed to adjust collection time interval taking load forecasting and spot trading business as examples, using forecast accuracy and power purchase cost as indicators. Finally, it is determined that when the collection frequency is one minute, it could meet the indicator that the average absolute percentage error of load forecast was less than 1%. And in the meantime, the purchase cost deviation of the electricity sellers was much smaller than the 2% error specified by the standard. © 2021 IEEE.",advanced metering infrastructure; digital twin; load forecasting; online optimization; spot trading,Advanced metering infrastructures; Data privacy; Digital twin; Electric power plant loads; Forecasting; Information systems; Information use; Research and development management; Application systems; Auxiliary information; Collection frequency; Collection systems; Comprehensive analysis; Electricity-consumption; Power supply bureaux; Supporting systems; Costs,,,,,,,,"Xiao, Y., Zhao, W., Luo, R., Survey of digital energy measurement algorithms[J] (2018) Electrical Measurement & Instrumentation, 55 (7), pp. 1-7; Yan, Y., Tao, H., Li, Y., Research and practice of integration of information in power dispatching center[J] (2007) Power System Protection and Control, 35 (17), pp. 37-40. , 71; Bai, H., Zhou, C., Yuan, Z., Prospect and thinking of digital power grid based on digital twin[J] (2020) Southern Power System Technology., 14 (8), pp. 18-24; Boschert, S., Rosen, R., Digital twin-The simulation aspect [m] (2016) Mechatronic Futures., pp. 59-74. , Springer, Cham; He, X., Ai, Q., Zhu, T., Opportunities and challenges of the digital twin in power system applications[J] (2020) Power System Technology., 44 (6), pp. 2009-2019; Li, R., (2017) Research on the Application of Measurement Automation System in Distribution Marketing Management[D]., , Guangzhou: South China University of Technology Guangzhou Master's Degree Thesis; Wang, Y., Yang, J., Design and application of metering automation system in large power supply enterprise[J] (2011) Electrical Measurement& Instrumentation, 48 (11), pp. 63-66. , 71; Li, M., (2017) Research and Application of Electric Power Measurement Automation System in the Integration of Marketing Service and Distribution Production[D]., , Guangzhou: South China University of Technology Guangzhou Master's Degree Thesis; Wang, H., (2016) Improvement of Application Function of Shenzhen Electric Energy Metering Automation System[D]., , Guangzhou: South China University of Technology Guangzhou Master's Degree Thesis; Gong, G., Wang, H., Zhang, T., Research on electricity market about spot trading based on blockchain[J] (2018) Proceedings of the Csee, 38 (23), pp. 6955-6966; Yu, D., (2017) Research on Demand Response Mechanism and Short-Term Load Forecasting Model under Smart Grid [D]., , Qingdao University; Zheng, R., Gu, J., Jin, Z., Research on short-Term load forecasting variable selection based on fusion of data driven method and forecast error driven method[J] (2020) Proceedings of the CSEE., 40 (2), pp. 487-500; Wei, H., Tao, Y., Cai, C., Hu, G., Short-Term load forecasting based on improved long short-Term memory neural network[J] (2020) Electrical Measurement & Instrumentation, 57 (19), pp. 93-98; Pang, C., Yu, J., Feng, C., Clustering modeling and characteristic analysis of power load based on long-short-Term memory auto-encoder[J] (2020) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 44 (23), pp. 57-63; Zou, H., Dou, Z., Zhang, B., Short-Term load forecasting based on lifting wavelet and improved pso-elman neural network[J] (2020) Electrical Measurement & Instrumentation, 57 (21), pp. 119-125; Yue, Y., Liu, Y., Zhao, H., Wang, H., Short-Term load forecasting based on ceemdan-se and dbn[J] (2020) Electrical Measurement & Instrumentation, 57 (17), pp. 59-65",,,54th Institute;Chongqing Institute of Electronics;Chongqing University;Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications;et al.;Sichuan Institute of Electronics,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"13th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks, ICCSN 2021",4 June 2021 through 7 June 2021,,171167,,9.78E+12,,,,,,,,,

For bridges this control is carried out by qualified engineers in regular inspections. The analysis of the condition and its expected development is mainly determined by cyclic measurements detected with human senses. In other industries (e. g. aviation, power plants) full automated monitoring and evaluation of the condition using digital sensors is already common. This allows a real-time monitoring and a predictive maintenance. This digital transformation has not been transferred into civil engineering. This can be explained with the individuality, the dimensions, the long live-time and the relatively small rate of change of the most important vital parameters of bridge structures. But the transition to a digital maintenance of our infrastructure is essential to be able to evaluate our existing structures, to detect the initiation or the progress of degradation processes and to shift from a reactive to a predictive maintenance. A strategy to achieve this goal is the realisation of a digital bridge twin. Based on a three-dimensional BIM model of the geometry the condition is detected and determined by a combination of cyclic results from bridge inspections and other diagnostic evaluations supplemented by real-time monitoring data. The paper gives an overview over the concept of digital bridge twins and over the potential for geodetic techniques which allow and support the transition to a digital infrastructure. The actual state of the art concerning digital bridge twin is given in /Marx et al. o. D./. © 2021, VDE VERLAG GMBH.

In order to estimate the potential of regulating water heaters at the aggregated level, factors including user behavior, number of water heaters, and types of water heaters must be considered. This study develops generic water heater load curves based on the data retrieved from large experimental projects for resistive electric water heaters (EWHs) and heat pump water heaters (HPWHs). A community-level digital twin with scalability has been developed to capture the aggregated hot water flow and average hot temperature in the tank. The results in this paper also include the 'energy take' in line with the CTA-2045 standard and Energy Star specification. The data from the experiments demonstrated that changing from an EWH to an HPWH reduces electricity usage by approximately 70%. The case study showed that daily electricity usage could be shifted by approximately 14% and 17% by EWH and HPWHs, respectively, compared to their corresponding average power. Another case study showed that both EHWs and HPWHs, coordinated with PV to reduce morning and evening peaks, could shift approximately 22% of the daily electricity. © 2013 IEEE.",aggregated community load; CTA-2045; demand response (DR); digital twin; distributed energy resources (DER); Electric water heater (EWH); energy storage; energy take; generic curve; heat pump water heater (HPWH); load profile; smart grid; smart home; virtual power plant (VPP),Automation; Behavioral research; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Energy resources; Flow of water; Heat pump systems; Heat resistance; Pumps; Smart power grids; Temperature measurement; Water heaters; Aggregated community load; CTA-2045; Demand response; Distributed energy resource; Distributed Energy Resources; Electric water heater; Electric water heaters; Energy; Energy take; Heat pump water heater; Heat pumps; Load profiles; Power; Power measurement; Resistance-heating; Schedule; Smart grid; Smart homes; Virtual power plant; Virtual power plants; Water heating; Digital storage,,,,,,,,"Hiller, C.C., Comparing water heater vs. hot water distribution system energy losses (2005) ASHRAE Trans., 111, p. 407. , Oct; Gong, H., Rallabandi, V., Ionel, D.M., Colliver, D., Duerr, S., Ababei, C., Dynamic modeling and optimal design for net zero energy houses including hybrid electric and thermal energy storage (2020) IEEE Trans.

Its main advantage over Brayton cycles with other working fluids is its high net efficiency. To maintain this efficiency, the compressor must operate close to the critical point of CO2 (7.32 MPa and 31 °C). Maintaining a near constant inlet temperature is crucial, posing a design and operations challenge. In this study, we simulate the air cooler in an sCO2 power plant using a dynamic model with a focus on transient analysis. This was done for a 100 MWe sCO2 power cycle molten salt application (solar and nuclear reactors). For transient analysis, step changes in ambient temperature were simulated. A parametric study was also conducted using the model in steady-state. The model was implemented using the Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES) Process Systems Engineering (PSE) framework, an open-source software package. A brief description of the software architecture is given. Model applications and its overall fit in the digital twin landscape are also discussed.

Digital Twin and Machine Learning (ML) are important techniques in this transformation as it complements and improves the traditional expert-based knowledge systems. There is a continued trend to use data-driven, so-called black-box, ML techniques as an improvement over traditional statistical approaches. However, these ML approaches suffer from low interpretability or explainability, making it hard to trust how or why a certain anomaly in the system is detected, limiting the trust in the prediction and making it much less likely to identify the real original cause of the problem. In this paper, we present our lesson learnt from operationalizing ML in a real-world use case that studied data from the 1.85 MWe OPRA OP16 all radial single-shaft gas turbine. We comment on the unforeseen obstacles we uncovered during our ML anomaly detection application and juxtapose them with the high potential value that our novel ML applications and explanation method can provide. ML may be enticing for the predictive maintenance of gas turbines but our lesson makes it clear that operationalizing ML goes beyond merely algorithm specifics. In line with the nature of the Digital Twin, it requires careful consideration of the specialized IT system supporting the algorithm, and the specific process it supports and in which it is deployed. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

The digital twin is a digital model, a physics-based representation of the actual asset. The model is thermodynamic and is created with the intent to support 5 M&D areas: Integrate with existing M&D tools such as advanced pattern recognition (APR) Power plant performance prediction and trending such as day, week, and month ahead performance prediction for capacity and generation planning Health Monitoring and Fault Diagnostics to support asset management with additional health scores and virtual instrumentation enabled by the digital twin model Monitoring and prediction of both base and part-load performance. Many gas turbine tools have been simplified to work only at full load conditions. To be useful and to improve utilization of collected data, part-load conditions should also be considered. Outage and repair impacts, including ""what-if"" capability to understand and quantify potential root causes of less than expected performance improvement or recovery after outage and repairs. This paper presents current progress in creating an EPRI Digital Twin applicable to gas turbines. The formulation, methodology, and real-world use cases are presented. To date, digital twins have been created and tested for both E and F class frames. This paper describes the process of generating closedform equations capable of transforming existing, measured historian data into the health parameters and virtual sensors needed to better track unit health and monitor faulted performance. These equations encapsulate the digital twin physical model and provide end-users with a methodology to calibrate to their specific unit and efficiently use their choice of monitoring software. Tests have been performed using operator data and have shown good accuracy at detecting anomalous operation and predicting week ahead performance with excellent accuracy. Post-outage impact analysis is also assessed. Real-world application cases for the digital twin are also presented. Examples include using the digital twin to identify causes of post-outage emissions and performance issues, expected impact of degradation and fault conditions, and simulating improvements to operation through part repair and upgrades. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Performance prediction, monitoring of degradation effects, and a faster recognition of anomalous events during power plant load following operations and/or due to cyber-Attacks can be easily detected with the support of digital twin environments. In the research work described in this article, a digital twin environment was developed to capture the dynamics of a micro compressorturbine system modified for hybrid configuration at the Department of Energy s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). The innovative approach for the development of the digital twin environment was based on creating a compressorturbine physics-based model using a stateless methodology generally utilized for microservices architectures. The advantage of using this approach was represented by modeling individual or a group of power plant components on distributed computational resources such as clouds in a lightweight and interchangeable manner. Supplemental data analytics were performed using an online system identification tool developed in previous work and applied to an unmeasurable parameter only available in the digital twin system. This work demonstrated the ability to train a recursive algorithm to predict a supplemental parameter for faster anomaly detection or for replacing the physics-based model during design or monitoring of operational systems. The thermodynamic compressor-Turbine net power was the unmeasurable parameter only available in the digital twin model, which was predicted with the online system identification tool. Results showed that the online system identification algorithm predicted the dynamic response of the thermodynamic net power based on a set of experimental data points at nominal operating conditions with an absolute mean percentage error of ~0.644%. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

APH fouling occurs due to deposition of ash particles and products formed by reactions between leaked ammonia from the upstream selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit and sulphur oxides (SOx) present in the flue gases. Fouling is strongly influenced by concentrations of ammonia and sulphur oxide as well as the flue gas temperature within APH. It increases the differential pressure across APH over time, ultimately leading to forced outages. Owing to lack of sensors within APH and the complex thermo-chemical phenomena, fouling is quite unpredictable. We present a deep learning based model for forecasting the gas differential pressure across the APH using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained and tested with data generated by a plant model, validated against an industrial scale APH. The model forecasts the gas differential pressure across APH within an accuracy band of 5-10% up to 3 months in advance, as a function of operating conditions. We also propose a digital twin of APH that can provide real-Time insights into progression of fouling and preempt the forced outages. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

In the meantime, the increasing penetration of an array of information technologies and controllable devices together suggests that the communications networks enact critical roles in the electric power infrastructure. Indeed, reconfiguration of the current structure of the multi-carrier energy networks by incorporating the advanced communication protocols is one of the essential steps in the grid modernization process. Therefore, this chapter is developed to introduce the required communication systems for modernizing future energy networks. In this regard, the key role of the communication platforms in coordinating the grid agents is examined considering the effective participation of the various control centers and intelligent devices throughout the modern grid.

Smart technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Twin (DT), etc. enable companies within the sector of renewable energies to drastically improve their operations. In this sectoral context, where upgraded sustainability standards also play a vital role, it is necessary to fulfil the human capital requirements of the imminent technological advances. This article aims to determine the current skills of the renewable energy industry workforce and to predict the upcoming skill requirements linked to a digital transition by creating a unified database that contains both types of skills. This will serve as a tool for renewable energy businesses, education centers, and policymakers to plan the training itinerary necessary to close the skills gap, as part of the sectoral strategy to achieve a competent future workforce. © 2021 by the authors.

A frequently used keyword in this context is digital twin. In this work, the term digital twin is defined with regard to a flexible air separation unit. Furthermore, the digital twin's core component, a highly detailed dynamic plant model, is presented. A pressure-driven approach is used as a basis for the modeling. The focus of this work is on the distillation columns. Therefore, a pressure-driven sieve tray column model is presented using design correlations for the calculation of pressure drop and both the liquid and vapor holdup. Furthermore, two industrially relevant load change scenarios are presented and discussed. A plant shutdown is simulated until a state of cold standby is reached. Then, starting from this state a cold restart is simulated. Cold standby means that the plant remains at cryogenic temperatures. Lastly, a hazard analysis is conducted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Air separation unit; Digital twin; Dynamic simulation; Flexible operation; Pressure-driven simulation; Renewable energies,Distillation columns; Separation; Air separation unit; Core components; Dynamics simulation; Flexible operation; Plant model; Pressure-driven; Pressure-driven simulation; Process industries; Renewable energies; Simulation approach; Plant shutdowns,,,,,"Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF: FKZ 03SFK3E1-2","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Kopernikus project SynErgie by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, FKZ 03SFK3E1-2) and the project supervision by the project management organization Projektträger Jülich (PtJ).",,"Amrit, R., Rawlings, J.B., Angeli, D., Economic optimization using model predictive control with a terminal cost (2011) Annu.

The purpose of the study is to formulate the content and key directions of learning processes based on modeling and the formation of digital twins for the production and consumption of goods. The research method is based on the analysis of structural links in socio-economic systems, where the potential of human capital is realized. The study describes a trialectic model for the system development mechanism, which gives grounds to distinguish three types of essential components of implementing the specialists competencies (material, information, and communication). Based on the concept of ""system of systems"", the necessity of multifunctional training of specialists for socio-economic systems is substantiated and shown on the list of personal knowledge/ skills in the renewable energy sector. Recent trends in the reproduction of human capital, such as intellectualization, increased communication, internationalization, acquisition of skills, customization, and communication with consumers, are stated in line with Industries 4.0 and 5.0. The potential for future research is aimed at harmonizing relations between humans and cyber-physical systems, motivating the needs for selfdevelopment, and using disruptive technologies in the reproduction of human capital. © 2021 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

The digital twin of the electrical grid is created via synchronization between the real-time simulator and the supervision, control and data acquisition system. The digital twin can be integrated to larger system with the addition of simulated devices, with or without reconfiguration of topology. The setup is then completed with power-hardware-in-the-loop interface where the real distributed energy resource can be physically integrated. The impact can then be analysed locally and globally as it propagates through the desired deployment environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Digital twin; Distributed renewable energy resources; Holistic testing; Power-hardware-in-the-loop; SCADA-as-a-service,Data acquisition; Digital devices; Digital integrated circuits; Digital twin; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Synthetic apertures; Control and data acquisition systems; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed renewable energy resources; Electrical grids; Integrated power; Power hardware in the loops; Real time simulators; Renewable energy resources,,,,,"654113, 870620",This work is supported by the European Community’s Horizon 2020 Program - under the project “ERIGrid” (Grant Agreement No. 654113) and ERIGrid II (Grant Agreement No. 870620).,,"Nguyen, V.H., (2017); van Der Meer, A.A., Cyber-physical energy systems modeling, test specification, and co-simulation based testing (2017) Workshop on Modeling and Simulation of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems, , .

The emergence of information technologies such as Digital Twins (DT) in the field of the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 allows a substantial development in automatic diagnostic systems. The objective of this work is to obtain the DT of a Photo-voltaic Solar Farm (PVSF) with a deep-learning (DL) approach. To build such a DT, sensor-based time series are properly analyzed and processed. The resulting data are used to train a DL model (e.g., autoencoders) in order to detect anomalies of the physical system in its DT. Results show a reconstruction error around 0.1, a recall score of 0.92 and an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.97. There-fore, this paper demonstrates that the DT can reproduce the behavior as well as detect efficiently anomalies of the physical system. © 2021 by the authors.

Off-grid water filtration plants are an alternative for communities where transportation of freshwater becomes a real challenge due to a lack of infrastructure for the water potabilization processes. For such potable water filtration plants, hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) can be a viable solution to meet their energy demand meanwhile providing a sustainable water solution. The main contribution of this work is the unique methodology, which starts with a sizing procedure of various hybrid energy systems using a commercial software “Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER)” and spreadsheet algorithms, followed by a “Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)” based multiobjective optimization. Single-objective optimization scenarios contain photovoltaic installation capacity, wind turbines, diesel generators, and battery energy storage systems including Pb-acid (Lead-acid), Li-ion (Lithium-ion), and AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) technologies as design variables to maximize the cost of electricity or net-present-cost. Multiobjective optimization also involved environmental (CO2 emissions i.e. carbon dioxide emissions) and water cost indices as an additional packet to single-objective optimization scenarios. Afterward, a multicriteria decision-making tool using “The Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” is applied on the Pareto front to attain the final optimization results. The analysis is further explored in depth by generating digital twins (surrogate or meta model) of HRES data using artificial intelligence techniques (artificial neural network and group-method-of-data-handling). Furthermore, calculus and statistical sensitivity analysis assist in the identification of the significant variables in the design procedure. In summary, the technical contribution of this work can be divided into two sections. The first one is the design of a hybrid energy system for the water management of an isolated community of the indigenous Mayan region of Yucatan, Mexico, which has never been considered before. Secondly, the technical contribution is related to the usage of environmental emissions as an objective function, which is not considered in the traditional design of hybrid energy systems by the software HOMER. Environmental emission as an objective function is not considered while designing a hybrid energy system in commerical softwares like HOMER, in fact, HOMER provides a list of environmental impacts but it is a secondary outcome as a result of technoeconomic optimization. Analysis of results between HOMER pro and spreadsheet has shown conformity, reporting that the optimal case consists of a photovoltaic system, diesel generator, and Li-ion technology of battery storage with capacities of ∼17 kW, ∼5kW, and 44–48 kWh, respectively, corresponding to a net present cost ranging from 70,000 United States Dollars (USD) to 79,000 USD and a cost of electricity ranging from 0.205 to 0.229 USD/kWh. The achievements obtained with multiobjective optimization indicate that the cost of electricity and net present cost can be further reduced by 0.86 % and 0.73 %, respectively, at a decrement of only 0.4% of the renewable fraction as compared to the single objective optimization scenario. It is concluded that multiobjective optimization provides an add-in feature to HOMER by using environmental emissions as an objective function. The design procedure and adapted methodology can be useful to promote sustainable development in the statewide context and can provide a scientific justification to national energy policymakers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Digital twin; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Optimization; Potable water filtration; Sensitivity analysis; Wastewater treatment; Water-energy nexus,Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Data handling; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Lithium-ion batteries; Neural networks; Potable water; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water filtration; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid optimization; Hybrid renewable energies; Hybrid renewable energy system; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Potable water filtration; Single objective optimization; Water energy; Water-energy nexus; Multiobjective optimization; alternative energy; artificial intelligence; computer simulation; drinking water; genetic algorithm; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis; wastewater treatment; water management; water planning; Mexico [North America]; Yucatan,,,,,"Facultad de Química, Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT; Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán, UADY: 1006703, 1007727, 752330, 752354, 784785, 784880, 861995, 949314","The authors, Rasikh Tariq, A.J.

But, to ensure fulfillment of contracts under these circumstances, a vast number of possible scenarios, incorporating uncertain supply and demand, has to be simulated ahead of time. This many-query gas network simulation task can be accelerated by model reduction, yet, large-scale, nonlinear, parametric, hyperbolic partial differential(-algebraic) equation systems, modeling natural gas transport, are a challenging application for model order reduction algorithms. For this industrial application, we bring together the scientific computing topics of: mathematical modeling of gas transport networks, numerical simulation of hyperbolic partial differential equation, and parametric model reduction for nonlinear systems. This research resulted in the morgen (Model Order Reduction for Gas and Energy Networks) software platform, which enables modular testing of various combinations of models, solvers, and model reduction methods. In this work we present the theoretical background on systemic modeling and structured, data-driven, system-theoretic model reduction for gas networks, as well as the implementation of morgen and associated numerical experiments testing model reduction adapted to gas network models. © 2021, The Author(s).",Digital twin; Empirical Gramians; Gas network; Hyperbolic systems; Model reduction,Economics; Nonlinear equations; Parameter estimation; Renewable energy resources; Software testing; Well testing; Hyperbolic partial differential equation; Model order reduction; Model reduction method; Natural gas transport; Numerical experiments; Parametric modeling; Partial differential; Renewable energy source; Gases,,,,,"0324019B; National Science Foundation, NSF: DMS-1439786; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWi","This work is supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, in the joint project: “MathEnergy – Mathematical Key Technologies for Evolving Energy Grids”, sub-project: Model Order Reduction (Grant number: 0324019B), and by the National Science Foundation under Grant number: DMS-1439786 while the author was in residence at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics in Providence, RI, during the “Model and dimension reduction in uncertain and dynamic systems” program.

Instantaneous response to critical situations is essential for the integration of renewable energies. The most widely used standards for clock synchronisation, such as Network Time Protocol (NTP) and Precision Time Protocol (PTP), do not allow for achieving synchronised simultaneous sampling in distributed systems. In this work, a novel distributed synchronism system based on the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standard has been validated for its integration in an architecture oriented towards the high-resolution digitisation of photovoltaic (PV) generation systems. This method guarantees a time stamping with an optimal resolution that allows for the analysis of the influence of fast-evolving atmospheric fluctuations in several plants located in the same geographical area. This paper proposes an enhanced micro-phasor measurement unit (µPMU) that acts as a phasor meter and TSN master controlling the monitoring system synchronism. With this technique, the synchronism would be extended to the remaining measurement systems that would be involved in the installation at distances greater than 100 m. Several analyses were carried out with an on-line topology of four acquisition systems capturing simultaneously. The influence of the Ethernet network and the transducers involved in the acquisition process were studied. Tests were performed with Ethernet cable lengths of 2, 10, 50, and 75 m. The results were validated with 24-bit Sigma-Delta converters and high-precision resistor networks specialised in high-voltage monitoring. It was observed that with an appropriate choice of sensors and TSN synchronism, phase errors of less than ±1µs can be guaranteed by performing distributed captures up to 50 kS/s. Statistical analysis showed that uncertainties of less than ±100 ns were achieved with 16-bit Successive Approximation Register (SAR) converters at a moderate cost. Finally, the requirements of the IEEE C37.118.1-2011 standard for phasor measurement units (PMU) were also satisfied. This standard establishes an uncertainty of ±3.1 µs for 50 Hz systems. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a simultaneous sampling system for distributed acquisition systems coordinated by a µPMU. © 2021 by the authors.

However, many of these processes are not optimally designed, so expensive enzymes and substrates are wasted. Mathematical models and Digital Twins (DTs) are powerful tools, which can be used to optimize bioprocesses and, thus, increase the yield of the desired products. Individual enzymatic hydrolysis processes have already been modeled, but models for the combined starch hydrolysis and proteolysis, or DTs, are not available yet. Therefore, an easily adaptable, dynamic, and mechanistic mathematical model representing the kinetics of the enzymatic hydrolysis process of the combined starch hydrolysis and proteolysis was developed and parameterized using experimental data. The model can simulate the starch hydrolysis process with an agreement of over 90% and the proteolysis process with an agreement of over 85%. Subsequently, this model was implemented into an existing DT of a 20 L stirred tank reactor (STR). Since the DT cannot only map the kinetics of the enzymatic process, but also the STR with the associated periphery (pumps, heating jacket, etc.), it is ideally suited for future process control strategy development and thus for the optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis processes.

The traditional worst-case planning approaches in the low-voltage grid will lead to excessive grid extensions. In this paper, through a digital twin of the low-voltage grid, the true status of the physical grid is used to detect grid bottlenecks and therefore allows to match grid investments to actual needs in the distribution grid. This paper presents preliminary results from a real case study for the novel planning approach which lead to an accurate picture of grid hosting capacity, which is a major step forward from previously used worst case assumptions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Digital twin; Grid measurements; Hosting capacity; Low-voltage grid,Continuous measurements; Distribution grid; Energy transitions; Grid extension; Grid measurement; Grid-based; Hosting capacity; Load patterns; Low-voltage grid; Physical grid; Investments,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 774145",Acknowledgments.

It is well-known that the interconnection of power electronic converters can be a source of instabilities. Traditionally, impedance-based stability analyses are performed using either the analytical description or the identification of the output impedance of the source converter and the input admittance of the load converter. However, this methodology is restricted by the small-signal conditions, which are usually violated in this kind of systems due to the high variability imposed by the renewable energy sources. In nonlinear systems, the stability analysis usually consists on the definition of the region of attraction around a stable equilibrium point. In the literature, the analysis of nonlinear systems is almost exclusively applied to analytical systems, where all the details are known. This paper proposes a black-box methodology to obtain the region of attraction of the equilibrium point of commercial off-the-shelf dc-dc converters working in power distribution systems. First, optimization algorithms are used to identify the parameters of a predefined structure, such that it is able to reproduce the dynamic behavior of the system. The parameters identified can be used to create a switching equivalent model that accounts for the nonlinearities produced by the switching process of the converters. Second, the bisection method is implemented to minimize the number of simulations needed to determine the region of stability accurately. The proposed methodology has been validated both with simulations and with an experimental setup. © 2013 IEEE.",Bisection method; black-box models; digital twin; GAPSO algorithm; nonlinear systems; optimization algorithms; parameters identification; power system dynamics; stability analysis; system identification,Electric power system stability; Natural resources; Nonlinear analysis; Nonlinear systems; Power electronics; Renewable energy resources; Stability; Analytical description; Nonlinear stability analysis; Optimization algorithms; Power distribution system; Power electronic converters; Region of stabilities; Renewable energy source; Source of instability; DC-DC converters,,,,,"DPI2016-78644-P; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO",This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Project IDENMRED under Grant DPI2016-78644-P.,,"Safipour, R., Sadegh, M.O., Optimal planning of energy storage systems in microgrids for improvement of operation indices (2018) Int.

Researchers across the world have been working on a spectrum of issues pertaining to the field of microgrids, ranging from control, operation and management aspects for the islanded, grid connected modes and the seamless transition aspects, to the protection and the power quality issues. These proposed solutions need rigorous testing under a wide range of dynamic conditions, before actual field deployment under diverse environments. Thus there needs to be a focus to develop fast, safe, accurate and reliable testing methods. Accuracy, flexibility, scalability, compactness, ease of implementation and economic viability are some of the common parameters which are used in the benchmarking of a testing methodology. These objectives are mostly in conflict with each other and thus need fresh out of the box solutions for the design and development of the testing methodologies. The chapter presents the fundamentals of and a comparison between the various testing techniques - ranging from off-line to real-time (RT) simulations, rapid controller prototyping, hardware in the loop (HIL): both the signal level (CHIL) and power level (PHIL), RT power level emulation, test-bed platforms, hybrid approaches/combinations of these techniques and novel solutions such as digital twin, blockchain and internet of things (IoT) based approaches. The future challenges in the area of microgrid testing are also discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Benchmarks; Hardware in the loop; Internet of things; Microgrid testing; Real-time simulation,,,,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the support from India-UK Centre for Education and Research in Clean Energy (IUCERCE), a project funded by Department of Science and Technology, India.",,"Vijay, A.S., Doolla, S., Chandorkar, M., Real-time testing approaches for microgrids (2017) IEEE J.

The cyber-physical systems utilize the embedded software and internet to connect and control the smart machines that are addressed by the internet of things (IoT). These cyber-physical systems are the basis of the fourth industrial revolution which is indexed by industry 4.0. In particular, industry 4.0 relies heavily on the IoT and smart sensors such as smart energy meters. The reliability and security represent the main challenges that face the industry 4.0 implementation. This paper introduces a new infrastructure based on machine learning to analyze and monitor the output data of the smart meters to investigate if this data is real data or fake. The fake data are due to the hacking and the inefficient meters. The industrial environment affects the efficiency of the meters by temperature, humidity, and noise signals. Furthermore, the proposed infrastructure validates the amount of data loss via communication channels and the internet connection. The decision tree is utilized as an effective machine learning algorithm to carry out both regression and classification for the meters’ data. The data monitoring is carried based on the industrial digital twins’ platform. The proposed infrastructure results provide a reliable and effective industrial decision that enhances the investments in industry 4.0. © 2021 by the authors.

In this development, the transition of the heating sector is still in its infancy despite the relatively large share of thermal energy in the total energy consumption. Industrial companies can contribute significantly to reduce CO2 emissions by using waste heat through connecting their industrial energy supply system (IESS) to a district heating system (DHS). This paper focuses on emission reduction potential of an (industrial) heat transfer station (HTS) regarding energy flexibility and sector coupling required for the successful integration of industrial waste heat. To optimize the operating behaviour of the HTS, a data and optimization model is integrated into a digital twin (DT) based on reference architecture model for industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0). Within the DT, the information, functional and business layer are modeled. The effects of operating the HTS supported by central modules of the DT are evaluated on one year’s data of an IESS of a real industrial site. The results show a potential operating cost reduction by 6 % for the IESS and increases in profits of 1.3 % for the DHS. Scope 2 emissions can be reduced by 25 % for the IESS and 180 % for the DHS respectively, strongly depending on emission factors and allocation methods. © 2021, The Author(s).",Digital twin; District heating systems; Heat transfer station; Industrial energy supply systems; Optimization; Smart grids,,,,,,"Bundesamt für Energie, UFE; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi",The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Project EnEff:Wärme – MeFlexWaerme by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and the project supervision by the Projektträger Jülich (PtJ).,"Publication costs were covered by the DACH+ Energy Informatics Conference Organizers, supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy.","Ancona, M.A., Branchini, L., Di Pietra, B., Melino, F., Puglisi, G., Zanghirella, F., Utilities substations in smart district heating networks (2015) Energy Procedia, 81, pp. 597-605; (2020) Anwendungsbilanzen Zur Energiebilanz Deutschland, , https://ag-energiebilanzen.de/index.php?article_id=29&fileName=ageb_19_v3.pdf, Endenergieverbrauch nach Energieträgern und Anwendungszwecken, Berlin; Ashtari Talkhestani, B., Jung, T., Lindemann, B., Sahlab, N., Jazdi, N., Schloegl, W., Weyrich, M., An architecture of an intelligent digital twin in a cyber-physical production system (2019) at - Automatisierungstechnik, 67 (9), pp. 762-782; Brückner, S., (2016) Industrielle Abwärme in Deutschland, , Technische Universität München, München; Chien, K.L., On the automatic control of generalized passive systems (1972) Trans Asme, 74, pp. 175-185; (2016) DIN SPEC 91345:2016-04 - Referenzarchitekturmodell Industrie 4.0 (RAMI4.0), , Beuth Verlag GmbH, Berlin; DIN V 18599-1 - Energetische Bewertung Von Gebäuden - Berechnung des Nutz-, End- und Primärenergiebedarfs Für Heizung, Kühlung, Lüftung (2018) Trinkwarmwasser Und Beleuchtung, , Berlin, Deutschland; Dong, Y., Zou, B., A research of real-time pricing mechanism and its characteristics (2015) J Power Energy Eng, 3, p. 240; Kavvadias, K., Jiménez-Navarro, J.P., Thomassen, G., (2019) Decarbonising the EU Heating Sector: Integration of the Power and Heating Sector (JRC technical reports), , Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg; Kleinertz, B., Gruber, A., Veitengruber, F., Kolb, M., Roon, S., Flexibility potential of industrial thermal networks through hybridization (2019) 11.

In the power system protection field, digital twins for protection devices and relay test sets have been recently developed. When these two digital twins can interoperate, the highly specialized branch of the electrotechnical community, the protection of the power systems, sees the possibility to perform virtual tests of protection relays. This paper details about the today's possibilities offered by the virtual testing of power system protection relays, elaborating on the economic benefits introduced by the virtual commissioning tests, on the advantages offered on the quality of the delivered protection system and on important possibilities offered by virtual training. Subsequently the paper elaborates on the reasonable next steps for the development of this technology, from open loop testing to closed loop testing, identifying particular areas of research involvement at the academic level.

However, because of the high complexity, dynamics, and large-scale of these two systems, it is challenging to study their operation problems systematically, especially in severe conditions, e.g., the 2021 winter Texas power traffic crisis. With artificial intelligence, federated learning, edge computing, and automatic control, a digital twin based smart city is proposed in this paper and it focuses on two applications: smart transportation and smart energy grid. Both systems are presented in a structured design manner with several components in the digital twin system, which also contains many real-implementations of different scenarios. The proposed digital twin of a smart city provides a potential clue for the problems mentioned above. © 2021 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; Digital Twin; Edge Computing; Federated Learning; Smart Energy System;

In order to realize the digitalization and digital twin of power grid, an extensive sense network based on all sorts of smart sensors must be established. Among the sense network, current is one of the most important sense quantities, which provide fundamental data for monitoring, metering and protection of power grid. Most of the present current measurement methods require the contact with the conductor, and can only measure one current at the same time. However, there are plenty of multi-conductors in power grid such as bundled line and multicore cable, which require a new measurement method to obtain values of multiple currents simultaneously. Thus, a non-contact current measurement method for multi-conductor is proposed in this paper. Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) is adopted as core sense unit. Electromagnetic field theory and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are applied to achieve the measurement of multiple currents. Simulation models and examples are established and analyzed to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. © 2021 IEEE.",current; digital twin; magnetoresistance sensor; measurement method; multi-conductor; non-contact; PSO; smart grid,Digital twin; Electric current measurement; Electromagnetic field theory; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Tunnelling magnetoresistance; Digital transformation; Magnetoresistance sensors; Measurement methods; Multi-conductor; Multicore cables; Multiple currents; New Measurement Method; Tunnel magnetoresistance; Electric power transmission networks,,,,,,,,"Gelernter, D., (1991) Mirror Worlds or the Day Software Puts the Universe in A Shoebox: How Will It Happen and What It Will Mean; Xu, Y., A digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis using deep transfer learning (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 19990-19999; Grieves, M.W., (2019) Virtually Intelligent Product Systems: Digital and Physical Twins, pp. 175-200; Tao, F., Zhang, M., Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 20418-20427; Rolle, R., Martucci, V., Godoy, E., Architecture for digital twin implementation focusing on industry 4. 0 (2020) IEEE Latin America Transactions, 18 (5), pp. 889-898. , May; Qi, Q., Tao, F., Digital twin and big data towards smart manufacturing and industry 4. 0: 360 degree comparison (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 3585-3593; Ueno, T., Higuchi, T., Dynamic response in magnetic force control using a laminate composite of magnetostrictive and piezoelectric materials (2005) IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, 41 (3), pp. 1082-1085. , March; Sekiguchi, K., Saitoh, E., Miyajima, H., Nanocontact magnetoresistance and quantized conductance (2005) IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, 41 (10), pp. 2565-2567. , Oct; Useinov, A.N., Useinov, N.K., Ye, L., Wu, T., Lai, C., Tunnel magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions with embedded nanoparticles (2015) IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, 51 (11), pp. 1-4. , Nov; You, C., Kim, H., Effect of finite tunneling magnetoresistance for the switching dynamics in the spin transfer torque magnetic tunneling junctions (2017) IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, 53 (11), pp. 1-4. , Nov; Kalhor, H.A., The degree of intelligence of the law of biot-savart (1990) IEEE Transactions on Education, 33 (4), pp. 365-366. , Nov; Llerena-Pizarro, O., Proenza-Perez, N., Tuna, C.E., Silveira, J.L., A pso-bpso technique for hybrid power generation system sizing (2020) IEEE Latin America Transactions, 18 (8), pp. 1362-1370. , August; Sandre-Hernandez, O., Morales-Caporal, R., Rangel-Magdaleno, J., Peregrina-Barreto, H., Hernandez-Perez, J.N., Parameter identification of pmsms using experimental measurements and a pso algorithm (2015) IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 64 (8), pp. 2146-2154. , Aug; Das Sharma, K., Chatterjee, A., Rakshit, A., A random spatial lbest pso-based hybrid strategy for designing adaptive fuzzy controllers for a class of nonlinear systems (2012) IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 61 (6), pp. 1605-1612. , June; Tong, L., Li, X., Hu, J., Ren, L., A pso optimization scale-transformation stochastic-resonance algorithm with stability mutation operator (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 1167-1176; Alizadeh Moghaddam, S.H., Mokhtarzade, M., Moghaddam, S.A.A., Optimization of rfm's structure based on pso algorithm and figure condition analysis (2018) IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 15 (8), pp. 1179-1183. , Aug",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"4th International Conference on Energy, Electrical and Power Engineering, CEEPE 2021",23 April 2021 through 25 April 2021,,170494,,9.78E+12,,,English,"Int.

Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault. © 2021 IEEE.",Anomaly Detection; Convolutional Neural Network; Cyber Physical System; Deep Learning; Digital Twin; Fault Detection; Smart Grid; Wide Area Monitoring System,Anomaly detection; Convolutional neural networks; Data acquisition; Deep learning; Digital twin; Distributed parameter control systems; E-learning; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Fault detection; Outages; Phasor measurement units; Smart power grids; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Distributed control; High temporal resolution; Infrastructure security; Phasor measurement unit (PMUs); Power system operators; Supervisory control and dataacquisition systems (SCADA); Wide area monitoring system; Electric power system control,,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014-18-1-2396","This work was supported by the Office of Naval Research under Grant N00014-18-1-2396.

The idea of a digital twin is not new and has recently been proposed as a means to enable simulations for the purpose of environmental protection where tests on the real system are difficult or expensive. The novelty in our work is in proposing and analyzing the possibility to dynamically align the digital twin with its real counterpart. As a preliminary step toward the synthesis of a Digital Twin for the Smart Grid, we propose the adoption of an architectural view that gets dynamically aligned with the state of the world at deploy and operation time. In this manner, we lay out the basis for a maintenance-aware model, which is at the core of the “digital twin” concept. The availability of a digital twin allows the enforcement of policies for the devices when they connect to the Grid. This paves the way for a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), as introduced in this work. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Digital Twin; Security-by-design; Smart Grids; Zero Trust Architecture,Digital devices; Electric power transmission networks; Smart power grids; Architectural views; Cyber security; Lay-out; Operation time; Real systems; Security-by-design; Smart grid; Zero trust architecture; Architecture,,,,,,,,"Pavleska, T., Aranha, H., Masi, M., Sellitto, G.P.: Drafting a cybersecurity framework profile for smart grids in EU: a goal-based methodology.

Due to the lack of an operational application architecture model, it is impossible to map the complex system comprehensively. Based on the review of the concept model of DT and the current research situation in the smart grid (SG), an OKDD [i.e., ontology-body (OB), knowledge-body (KB), data-body (DB), and digital-portal (DP)] model of digital twin body (DTB) is proposed and specified in detail. Taking a vacuum circuit breaker and a 35 kV substation of the power grid as examples, the OKDD is applied in the DTB construction, and the developed prognostic and health management (PHM) system demo is practiced in a 110 kV substation simply. The approach is proved to be feasible preliminarily. This model provides a novel method for the unified description and standardization of DTB, which is conducive to the hierarchical creation (unit-system-system of systems) for complex systems. Meanwhile, it can represent complex physical entities more comprehensively, and enable the reuse of knowledge and the duplication of similar unit-level DTB rapidly. Thus, this research provides a new reference for the practical application of DT. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Application architecture; Digital twin; Digital twin body; Smart grid,Digital twin; Electric circuit breakers; Electric power transmission networks; Hierarchical systems; System of systems; Current research situation; Information engineerings; Intelligent solutions; Operational applications; Prognostic and health management; Reliability assurance; Unified description; Vacuum circuit breaker; Smart power grids,,,,,,,,"Batty, M., Digital twins (2018) Environ Planning B Urban Anal City Sci, 45 (5), pp. 817-820; Brosinsky, C., Westermann, D., Krebs, R., Recent and prospective developments in power system control centers: Adapting the digital twin technology for application in power system control centers (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE International Energy Conference (ENERGYCON), pp. 1-6. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ENERGYCON.2018.8398846; Cao, J., Wan, Y., Tu, G., Zhang, S., Xia, A., Liu, X., Chen, Z., Lu, C., Information system architecture for smart grids (2013) Chin J Comput, 36 (1), pp. 143-167; Chen, S., Chen, Z., The research of organizational knowledge management based on the differentiation between static knowledge and dynamic knowledge (2007) Sci Manage Res, 25 (2), pp. 69-72; Chen, Y., Chen, Y., Pei, Z., Wang, C., Digital twin: recent development and future trend from a bibliometrics perspective (2020) China Mech Eng, 31 (7), pp. 797-807; Dai, S., Zhao, G., Yu, Y., Wang, W., Trend of digital product definition: from mock-up to twin (2018) J Comput-Aided Design Comput Graphics, 30 (8), pp. 1554-1562; Fischer, G., Enhancing incremental learning processes with knowledge-based systems (1988) Learning issues for intelligent tutoring systems.

The application of such advanced capabilities particularly to highly digitalized processes such as metal additive manufacturing (AM) is likely to make those processes commercially more attractive. AI capabilities will reside within Digital Twins (DTs) which are living virtual replicas of the physical processes. DTs will be empowered to operate autonomously in a diagnostic control capacity to supervise processes and can be interrogated by the practitioner to inform the optimal processing route for any given product. The utility of the information gained from the DTs would depend on the quality of the digital models and, more importantly, their faster-solving surrogates which dwell within DTs for consultation during rapid decision-making. In this article, we point out the exceptional value of DTs in AM and focus on the need to create high-fidelity multiscale-multiphysics models for AM processes to feed the AI capabilities. We identify technical hurdles for their development, including those arising from the multiscale and multiphysics characteristics of the models, the difficulties in linking models of the subprocesses across scales and physics, and the scarcity of experimental data. We discuss the need for creating surrogate models using machine learning approaches for real-time problem-solving. We further identify non-technical barriers, such as the need for standardization and difficulties in collaborating across different types of institutions. We offer potential solutions for all these challenges, after reflecting on and researching discussions held at an international symposium on the subject in 2019. We argue that a collaborative approach can not only help accelerate their development compared with disparate efforts, but also enhance the quality of the models by allowing modular development and linkages that account for interactions between the various sub-processes in AM. A high-level roadmap is suggested for starting such a collaboration. © 2021 The Authors",Additive manufacturing; Artificial intelligence; Digital twins; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Multiphysics modeling; Multiscale modeling,Additives; Decision making; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Problem solving; Digital modeling; Machine-learning; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing process; Metal additives; Multi-physics modeling; Multiscale models; Process productivity; Process products; Products quality; 3D printers,,,,,"Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO; RMIT University, RMIT; University of Melbourne, UNIMELB","The authors thank the delegates of the International ?Towards a Digital Twin of Metal Additive Manufacturing?

Here, DTs for UWS are placed in the context of DTs at the component, unit process/operation or hydraulic structure, treatment plant, system, city, and societal levels. A UWS DT is characterized as a systematic virtual representation of the elements and dynamics of the physical system, organized in a star-structure with a set of features connected by data links that are based on standards for open data. This allows the overall functionality to be broken down into smaller, tangible units (features), enabling microservices that communicate via data links to emerge (the most central feature), facilitated by application programing interfaces (APIs). Coupled to the physical system, simulation models and advanced analytics are among the most important features. We propose distinguishing between living and prototyping DTs, where the term “living” refers to coupling observations from an ever-changing physical twin (which may change with, e.g., urban growth) with a simulation model, through a data link connecting the two. A living DT is thus a near real-time representation of an UWS and can be used for operational and control purposes. A prototyping DT represents a scenario for the system without direct coupling to real-time observations, which can be used for design or planning. By acknowledging that different DTs exist, it is possible to identify the value-creation from DTs achieved by different end-users inside and outside a utility organization. Analyzing the DT workflow in VCS shows that a DT must be multifunctional, updateable, and adjustable to support potential value creation across the utility company. This study helps clarify key DT terminology for UWS and identifies steps to create a DT by building upon digital ecosystems (DEs) and open standards for data. © 2021 by the authors.

It is due to the continuous improvement effort of these professionals and many rules they have to follow daily. Their activity presents risks, and it needs to be done carefully to safeguard their life. The electrical power sector has a short history and it has been considered a conservative sector, meaning, that the assets and the way they are operated have not been following all technological trends in industry. Those analysis lead to a major concern regarding the aging of workforces and how to transfer knowledge and experiences to a new workforce. In that sense, this paper proposes a smartphone application aiming to simplify the access to information during the execution of the on-field activities. The aforementioned app can automatically recognize some assets and show relevant information about them in Augmented Reality. Some benefits brought by this application include reducing time for asset identification, faster information finding, improving and agile problem solving avoiding the use of paper documents, etc. This application is implemented within the scope of Urban Futurability Project, an innovation project that ENEL Distribuiç ão Sao Paulo is carrying out in Brazil in the framework of the Brazilian regulator's RD) program. © 2021 IEEE.",Augmented Reality; Human Interface; Network Digital Twin®; Utilities Workforce,Application programs; Augmented reality; Electric power transmission networks; Asset identification; Augmented reality applications; Continuous improvements; Field activities; Innovation projects; Knowledge and experience; Smart-phone applications; Technological trends; Smart power grids,,,,,,A CKNO WLEDG MENT The authors thank the Research Progra m and Technological Develop ment of the electricity sector regulated by A N E E L and Enel Distribui¸c ão São Paulo for the financial supporttothe project.

Here, we present a novel projection pursuit recurrent neural network to identify functional mechanisms in the context of iterative supervised machine learning for discovery-based design optimization. Molecular function recognition is achieved by pairing experiments that categorize systems with digital twin molecular dynamics simulations to generate working hypotheses. Feature extraction decomposes emergent properties of a system into a complete set of basis vectors. Feature selection requires signal-to-noise, statistical significance, and clustering quality to concurrently surpass acceptance levels. Formulated as a multivariate description of differences and similarities between systems, the data-driven working hypothesis is refined by analyzing new systems prioritized by a discovery-likelihood. Utility and generality are demonstrated on several benchmarks, including the elucidation of antibiotic resistance in TEM-52 beta-lactamase.

Barriers to residential Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) autonomy as a service, include operational challenges in run-time safety compliance, reliability and resilience, due to the complexities of dealing with known and unknown risk in dynamic environments. In this paper we incorporate a Symbiotic System Of Systems Approach (SSOSA) that uses a Symbiotic Digital Architecture (SDA) to provide a cyber physical orchestration of enabling technologies. Implementing a SSOSA enables Cooperation, Collaboration and Corroboration (C3), as to address run-time verification of safety, reliability and resilience during autonomous missions. Our SDA provides a means to synchronize distributed digital models of the robot, environment and infrastructure. Through the coordinated bidirectional communication network of the SDA, the remote human operator has improved visibility and understanding of the mission profile. We evaluate our SSOSA in an asset inspection mission within a confined operating environment. Demonstrating the ability of our SSOSA to overcome safety, reliability and resilience challenges. The SDA supports lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing across the interconnected systems. Our results evaluate both sudden and gradual faults, as well as unknown events, that may jeopardize an autonomous mission. Using distributed and coordinated decision making, the SSOSA enhances the analysis of the mission status, which includes diagnostics of critical sub-systems within the resident robot. This evaluation demonstrates that the SSOSA provides enhanced run-time operational resilience and safety compliance to BVLOS autonomous missions. The SSOSA has the potential to be a highly transferable methodology to other mission scenarios and technologies, providing a pathway to implementing scalable autonomy as a service. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; autonomous systems; digital twin; non-destructive evaluation; resilient robotics; safety compliance; sensors; symbiotic systems; system ontology,Decision making; Electric utilities; Life cycle; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind farms; Reliability; Robotics; Safety engineering; Systems engineering; Autonomous system; Digital architecture; Non destructive evaluation; Resilient robotic; Safety compliances; Sensor; Symbiotic system; Symbiotics; System ontology; System-of-system approach; Nondestructive examination,,,,,"PCT/GB2017/053275; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/R026173/1","This work was supported in part by the Offshore Robotic for Certification of Assets (ORCA) Hub under EPSRC Project EP/R026173/1, EPSRC Holistic Operation and Maintenance for Energy (HOME) from Offshore Wind Farms; and in part by MicroSense Technologies Ltd.

Although vehicular edge caching can facilitate delay-bounded content transmission, constrained storage capacity and limited serving range of an individual cache server as well as highly dynamic topology of vehicular networks may degrade the efficiency of content delivery. To address the problem, in this article, we propose a social-aware vehicular edge caching mechanism that dynamically orchestrates the cache capability of roadside units (RSUs) and smart vehicles according to user preference similarity and service availability. Furthermore, catering to the complexity and variability of vehicular social characteristics, we leverage the digital twin technology to map the edge caching system into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the social relation model. Based on the social model, a new concept of vehicular cache cloud is developed to incorporate the correlation of content storing between multiple cache-enabled vehicles in diverse traffic environments. Then, we propose deep learning empowered optimal caching schemes, jointly considering the social model construction, cache cloud formation, and cache resource allocation. We evaluate the proposed schemes based on real traffic data. Numerical results demonstrate that our edge caching schemes have great advantages in optimizing caching utility.

The Brazilian government’s new regulatory sanitation framework [3] was approved in December 2019, establishing goals to accelerate water and sewerage coverage, stimulating private investors either to build new or to operate existing plants. However, the asset inventory handover process from the public to the private sector is unstructured, causing numerous operational and maintenance challenges to new operators and investors. This paper presents the digital transformation framework applied in Aegea, a private group of water and sewage utilities in Brazil, aiming to meet in a sustainable way a social, environmental and financial value (SLO - Social License to Operate) [15] by combining Building Information Modelling (BIM) [17] and Asset Management (AM) [8] disciplines. Aegea’s integrated approach, “Infra Inteligente” (Infra), introduces intelligent 3D models of Water and Sanitation business. The 3D business representations trigger the Digital Twin in unrivaled data and analytics visualization within a virtual reality environment supporting the organization to take strategic and tactical decisions to do the maintenance and operations of the inherited plants. By switching from reactive to proactive maintenance it will save millions of Brazilian Reais, extending the life of critical system assets and prevent the operation team from dealing with frequent and unpredictable equipment breakdowns. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",AM; BIM; Digital Twin; SLO,Architectural design; Data visualization; Digital twin; Maintenance; Privatization; Sanitation; Sewage; Sewers; Sustainable development; Three dimensional computer graphics; Virtual reality; Building Information Modelling; Digital transformation; Infrastructure assets; Maintenance and operation; Proactive maintenance; Social and environmental; Virtual-reality environment; Water and wastewater; Water treatment,,,,,,,,"https://www.abrhidro.org.br/SGCv3/publicacao.php?PUB=2&ID=162&SUMARIO=5250, ABRHIDRO.

It reviews the concept of ME and integrates ME with a MBSE framework for the development of the DT. The methodology is demonstrated through a case study where the UAS is deployed for a Last Mile Delivery (LMD) mission in a military context where adversaries are present, and a route optimization module recommends an optimal route to the user based on a variety of inputs including potential damage or destruction of the UAS by adversary action. The optimization module is based on Multiple Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) which analyzes predefined criteria which the user assessed would enable the successful conduct of the UAS mission. The article demonstrates that the methodology can execute a ME analysis for route selection to support a user’s decision-making process. The discussion section highlights the key MBSE artifacts and also highlights the benefits of the methodology which standardizes the decision-making process thereby reducing the negative impact of human factors which may deviate from the predefined criteria. © 2021 by the authors.

This is not a straightforward task because neither the relationship between the size of the userbase or its effectiveness is easily quantified, nor is it clear which threshold for the number of users would make the application ‘effective’. This paper presents an approach for estimating the number of users needed for location‐based crowdsourcing applications to work successfully, depending on the use case, the circumstances, and the criteria of success. It circumvents various issues, ethical or practical, in performing real‐world controlled experiments and tackles this challenge by developing an agent‐based modelling and simulation framework. This framework is tested on a specific scenario, that of missing children and the search for them. The search is performed with the contribution of citizens being made aware of the disappearance through a mobile application. The result produces an easily reconfigurable testbed for the effectiveness of citizen sensing mobile applications, allowing the study of the marginal utility of new users of the application. The resulting framework aims to be the digital twin of a real urban scenario, and it has been designed to be easily adapted and support decisions on the feasibility, evaluation, and targeting of the deployment of spatial crowdsourcing applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Most of the previous thermal stress reduction methods only scope on the local controller level for the individual converter. In the proposed method, a centralized system level strategy is designed to deal with the varying charging profiles in the electric vehicle charging station, where the proposed dispatch algorithm makes full use of the local control level thermal stress reduction methods, including the reactive power injection and the switching frequency variation, to adjust the power loss and reshape the thermal profiles for multiple grid-connected converters. The proposed thermal stress oriented dispatch (TSOD) strategy is described in this paper and its superior performance on the junction temperature profiles is validated through a real-time model-in-the-loop testing and a digital twin experimental prototype. © 2021 IEEE.",Ac-dc converter; Charging profile; Electric vehicle charging station; Junction temperature control; Power loss balance; Thermal stress reduction,Charging (batteries); Digital twin; Electric load dispatching; Electric losses; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Semiconductor devices; Switching frequency; Thermal stress; Vehicle-to-grid; Centralized systems; Dispatch algorithms; Electric vehicle charging; Experimental prototype; Grid-connected converters; Junction temperatures; Reactive power injections; Real time modeling; Electric power system control,,,,,,,,"Teng, F., Ding, Z., Hu, Z., Sarikprueck, P., Technical review on advanced approaches for electric vehicle charging demand management, part i: Applications in electric power market and renewable energy integration (2020) IEEE Trans.

The GPR is capable of capturing reflections that form high-resolution lines of the shallow subsurface and underground utility. These lines are processed by an expert who draws a 3D model of what was captured. For objects at different depths, different sizes and materials to be found by technology, the equipment must have a wide frequency range. Low frequency waves make it possible to identify larger objects at greater depths and high frequency waves detect smaller objects at low depths. This case study shows a practical example of the usage of the GPR in the underground distribution grid in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. It was carried out within the scope of a RD project called 'Urban Futurability', by Enel Dlstribulção São Paulo. The results of the scanning done over 9 km make it possible to use the 3D model combined with a high-precision GPS for the elaboration of an underground network project that draws the best path for the installations, identifying rocks, denser and less dense soils, groundwater and other interference, allowing the work to be executed in a more efficient way. © 2021 IEEE.",3D modeling; digitization; GPR; Network Digital Twin®; underground distribution grid,3D modeling; Geological surveys; Geophysical prospecting; Groundwater; Object detection; Underground electric power distribution; Ground penetrating radar (GPR); High frequency waves; Low-frequency waves; Underground distribution; Underground exploration; Underground networks; Underground utilities; Wide frequency range; Ground penetrating radar systems,,,,,"Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica, ANEEL","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors thank the Research Program and Technological Development of the electricity sector regulated by ANEEL and Enel Distribuição São Paulo for the financial support to the project.

This paper introduces a data driven approach to build a digital twin of a chemical production site to aid the relevant decision makers in defining and evaluating the economic impact of a long term (i.e. several months ahead) production planning. Each chemical plant and energy production unit on site is represented by simple regression models relating the consumption of raw materials and utilities to its products. The resulting system of algebraic equations has been inserted in an optimization environment with the objective of maximizing the profit. In the optimization, also the electricity and steam generation were introduced to obtain a global energy balance of the production site. This combination resulted in a multi period Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The effect of electricity price and external temperature on the optimization results are also investigated. © 2021 The Authors.

In a more specific sense, the on-field activities carried out by utilities workforce, can become safer with the use of IoT sensors. This technology transmits data related to courses capacitation and electricians' certification. This type of data is regulated and supervised by regulatory agents in the electrical sector, and inspection are performed periodically by the utilities in order to guarantee the safety criteria established by the regulation. In that sense, this paper aims to present the implementation of a smart badge, which communicates with the inspector's mobile devices in order to make a more dynamic and feasible inspection solution for field activities. The presented solution implements courses and PPE (Personal protective equipment) management features, in order to guarantee and safeguard the life of employees who perform in on-field activities.

It has been attempted to evaluate bridge resilience by developing a resilience matrix or single-measure index. However, existing studies overlooked the prevailing interdependency among various physical and social infrastructures. Moreover, the technical, organizational, social, and economic aspects of these infrastructures are of dynamic nature. Therefore, this study develops a causal loop diagram (CLD) of bridge resilience to explore and understand how other infrastructures and their dynamism influence bridge resilience. Total 21 bridge resilience factors are identified based on the literature review. Out of these, 14 bridge resilience factors are shortlisted by using the Delphi method. Along with these 14 shortlisted factors, four properties of resilience (robustness, rapidity, resourcefulness, redundancy) and four infrastructures (bridge, transportation network, other utility infrastructures, and governance system) are considered to develop CLD. Thus, eight causal loops are developed, validated, and presented for improving bridge resilience. Further, the proposed study can help to implement effective policies for improving urban resilience and developing a smart city digital twin (SCDT) system. © 2021 Proceedings of the 37th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2021.

Oil and gas companies strive to improve work efficiency and consistently develop and implement digital products. The realization of such complicated solutions requires deep diving into current business processes and transformation of them. This paper deals with implementation of digital management system for exploration and production wells. Digital management system for exploration and production wells is based on ideology of digital twin and act as a single window and single source of data for all exploration and production wells. Digital management system covers whole construction process started from planning stage to execution and results assessment and orchestrates the exchange of data between process phases and people involved in it. Transparency provided by the digital twin improves efficiency and accelerates well construction process. Cognitive assistants based on AI and ML techniques are implemented at every stage: while planning, the assistants search analogue wells, analyze its design and complications while drilling and provide recommendations for the most optimal well design, offers the optimum drilling mud density and recommends the most suitable set of logs to cover geological section uncertainty. At the execution stage, a number of ML assistants are used to increase efficiency and reduce risks while drilling: automatic method for anomaly detection while drilling to prevent complications while drilling, machine learning based model for automatic torque and drag control to control borehole condition to predict any signs of differential stuck, key sitting and pack-off, data-driven model for drilling bit position and direction determination to predict BHA position while drilling including a blind zone, data-driven model for the identification of the rock type at a drilling bit for correct geosteering application. © 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,Anomaly detection; Efficiency; Gas industry; Gasoline; Infill drilling; Information management; Public utilities; Data-driven model; Digital transformation; Drilling bit; Exploration and productions; Exploration drilling; Exploration wells; Management systems; Oil and gas companies; Production wells; While drillings; Uncertainty analysis,,,,,,,,"Simon, I., Koryabkin, V., Semenikhin, A., Gruzdev, A., (2018) Determination of Lithologic Difference at the Bottom of Wells Using Cognitive Technologies, , SPE-191605-18RPTC-MS; Koryabkin, V., Semenikhin, A., Baybolov, T., Gruzdev, A., Simonov, Y., Chebuniaev, I., Karpenko, M., Vasilyev, V., (2019) Advanced Data-Driven Model for Drilling Bit Position and Direction Determination during Well Deepening, , SPE-196458-MS; Mayani, M., Baybolov, T., Rommetveit, R., Inge Ødegaard, S., Koryabkin, V., Lakhtionov, S., (2020) Optimizing Drilling Wells and Increasing the Operation Efficiency Using Digital Twin Technology, , SPE-19966-MS; Golitsyna, M., Semenikhin, A., Chebuniaev, I., Vasilyev, V., Koryabkin, V., Makarov, V., Simon, I., Osmonalieva, O., Automatic Method for Anomaly Detection while Drilling First EAGE Digitalization Conference and Exhibition, , Presented at 30 November 3 December 2020, Vienna, Austria",,,,Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE),"SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition 2021, ATCE 2021",21 September 2021 through 23 September 2021,,171755,26386712,9.78E+12,PSAEE,,English,Proc SPE Annu Tech Conf Exhib,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116617058

A Digital Twin of the Organization (DTO) exploits these infrastructures to provide an accurate digital representation of the organization. Beyond the usual representation of devices, machines and physical assets supplied by Digital Twins, a DTO also include processes, services, people, roles, and all other relevant elements for the operation of organizations. Therefore, DTO can play a key role in realizing and analyzing aspects of organizations, assisting managers on the knowledge of the organization status, and foreseeing possible effects of potential changes in the organization. However, due to the dynamic, open, and ever-changing environment of organizations, an established DTO will soon degrade or even lose all its utility. Therefore, a DTO needs to evolve to recover its utility when the organization changes. The development of flexible, resilient, and easy to evolve DTO has not been well-addressed yet. Most of the existing proposals are context-dependent, system-specific, or focus on providing solutions in high-level abstraction. This work leverages Enterprise Architecture to propose an architectural pattern to serve as a blueprint toward the development of resilient DTO. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Architectural pattern; Enterprise architecture; Resilient Digital Twin of Organization,Digital devices; Architectural pattern; Changing environment; Data-driven methods; Digital representations; Enterprise Architecture; Organization changes; Physical assets; Potential change; Process service; Resilient digital twin of organization; Embedded systems,,,,,"Stiftelsen för Kunskaps- och Kompetensutveckling, KKS: 20200117","Acknowledgements.

While individual process steps frequently employ digital computer files, their relationships within the overall process are rarely captured. To address this issue, we extend the factFUSE system for managing versioned Web resources in the file system to capture provenance relationships. By introducing an extensible commit system, we enable recording the relations between digital files and resources in process steps (activities), which are then captured as RDF metadata using the W3C PROV standard. Our evaluation shows that users without prior experience in provenance management successfully employ the system to capture semantic process provenance, attesting to excellent usability and promising utility. factFUSE is available for practical use under open source GNU AGPLv3 license. © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

The chemical plants on site are heavily interconnected, i.e., the product of one plant is the raw material used in the next one and some of the plants use the steam produced from neighboring ones. This high degree of interconnection makes it quite difficult to assess the feasibility let alone the economic optimality of production and maintenance plans for the entire site. This research explores the use of a data-driven digital twin to simulate and assess these plans. Two value chains, i.e., a collection of plants converting raw material to valuable end products have been selected as a proof-of-concept for the entire site. Each plant has been modeled by utilizing simple or multiple regression. Each regression model correlates the final product of a plant with the needed raw materials or utilities (e.g., steam or electricity). All regression models have been found using the software JMP. Additionally, all relevant tanks used to stock raw materials, intermediates and final products have been modelled. This allowed for the visualization and troubleshooting of a particular component excess or shortage. The resulting system of 76 variables has been solved in MATLAB in a multi-period fashion, where a period represents a day. The simulation has been first performed on the training data set, and then on a validation period to verify the models' performance.

The COVID-19 crisis, as an exceptional event, showed the limits and the fragility of supply chains, with circular economy practices as a potential solution during and post-COVID. Reverse logistics (RL) is an important dimension of the circular economy which allows management of economic, social, and environmental challenges. Transportation is needed for RL to effectively operate, but research study on this topic has been relatively limited. New digitalization opportunities can enhance transportation and RL, and therefore further enhance the circular economy. This paper proposes to review practical research and concerns at the nexus of transportation, RL, and blockchain as a digitalizing technology. The potential benefits of blockchain technology through example use cases on various aspects of RL and transportation activities are presented. This integration and applications are evaluated using various capability facets of blockchain technology, particularly as an immutable and reliable ledger, a tracking service, a smart contract utility, as marketplace support, and as tokenization and incentivization. We also briefly introduce the physical internet concept within this context. The physical internet paradigm proposed last decade, promises to also disrupt the blockchain, transportation, and RL nexus. We include potential research directions and managerial implications across the blockchain, transportation, and RL nexus. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Blockchain technology; Reverse logistics; Supply chain; Sustainability; Transportation,COVID-19; detection method; economic conditions; supply chain management; tracking; transportation policy; transportation safety; transportation system,,,,,,,,"Dowlatshahi, S., The role of transportation in the design and implementation of reverse logistics systems (2010) Int.

As essential elements of distribution grids, user-side smart meters find many smart grid applications, for example to measure electrical energy use and facilitate communications. However, the service models of distribution grids remain under development in association with upgrading of user-side smart meters. These meters are resource constrained, and challenging to upgrade on a large scale. To address this issue, this article describes a container-driven service architecture, in which containers are used to create a virtual dedicated agent (digital twin) for each user-side smart meter. The agent can be deployed either in the cloud or on an edge system, and can be upgraded to support emerging smart grid applications, thus minimizing the future upgrading requirements of user-side smart meters. We built experimental test beds to verify the proposed architecture and evaluated its performance in real-world experiments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Cloud/edge computing; container; digital twin; meter upgrading; smart meter,Architecture; Electric power transmission networks; Smart meters; Smart power grids; Voltage distribution measurement; Cloud/edge computing; Distribution grid; Edge computing; Essential elements; Grid users; Information and Communication Technologies; Low-voltage distributions; Meter upgrading; Services Architectures; Smart grid applications; Containers,,,,,,,,"Ding, Y.M., Hong, S.H., Li, X.H., A demand response energy management scheme for industrial facilities in smart grid (2014) IEEE Trans.

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level. To sum up, improving the smart city's IoT-BDA system using the DL approach can reduce data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and offer actual efficacy, providing experimental references for the digital development of smart cities in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Big data analysis; Deep learning; Digital twins; Internet of Things; Smart city,Big data; Convolutional neural networks; Data communication systems; Data handling; Deep learning; E-learning; Energy efficiency; Information analysis; Probability distributions; Smart city; Big data analyse; Convolutional neural network; Data analysis system; Data-transmission; Deep learning; Distributed parallelism; Massive data; Multihop transmission; Multisource data; Parallelism strategies; Internet of things,,,,,"2019JZZY020101; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 41971341, 41971354, 61902203; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province: 2019A1515010748, 2019A1515011872","This work is Funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41971341 , 41971354 , 61902203 ), General Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (Grant No. 2019A1515010748 , 2019A1515011872 ), Key Research and Development Plan - Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of ShanDong Province, China ( 2019JZZY020101 ).",,"Alzahrani, S.M., Sensing for the Internet of Things and its applications (2017) In 2017 5th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops, FiCloudW, pp. 88-92. , IEEE; Al-Ali, A.R., Gupta, R., Zaman Batool, T., Landolsi, T., Aloul, F., Al Nabulsi, A., Digital twin conceptual model within the context of Internet of Things (2020) Future Internet, 12 (10), p. 163; El Marai, O., Taleb, T., Song, J., Roads infrastructure digital twin: A step toward smarter cities realization (2020) IEEE Netw., pp. 1-8; Austin, M., Delgoshaei, P., Coelho, M., Heidarinejad, M., Architecting smart city digital twins: combined semantic model and machine learning approach (2020) J.

Between these models, a highly time-sensitive mutual validation mechanism and a coherent and consistent control strategy are applied, which demand complex virtual-and-real world model-based information mapping and synchronization. Thus, this research proposes a semantic conceptual framework for industrial process modeling in the context of digital twins. Based on a hierarchical structure of digital twins, this framework modularizes the modeling process in terms of the semantic information modules of physics in the real-world phenomena, and clarifies inter-module associations and near-real-time data transmission coupled with virtual analysis in CAE environment so that the time-sensitive phenomenon information objects distributed on virtually-separated sub-level physics models can be supported for representing the real-world process comprehensively. Advanced feature concept is adopted to construct the digital models as the basic compositions of any virtual industrial process. The related feature definitions are extended in this work so that the common characteristics in the concept of digital twins could be generically and concisely represented. To validate the modeling method, the digital model of a prototyped High-velocity Oxygen-fuel (HVOF) coating process system was constructed as the case study. The data from the nozzle trajectory, the flame, and the in-flight particle behavior, and the transient thermal performance of the coating layer and substrate were synchronously incorporated for simulating the transient phenomena of the substrate component temperature and coating thickness distribution on the substrate surface. The final simulation result validates that the feature-based digital model is able to comprehensively reflect the real-world scenario on the virtual side. To illustrate how the developed model provides meaningful feedback to the real-world control, a general digital twin setup of the model is given at the end of the case study. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Digital twins in industry; Feature-based modeling; Industrial HVOF process modeling; Robotized thermal spray process,HVOF thermal spraying; Industrial research; Semantics; Sprayed coatings; Thickness measurement; Virtual reality; Case-studies; Digital modeling; Digital twin in industry; Feature-based model; High velocity oxygen fuels; Industrial high-velocity oxygen-fuel process modeling; Industrial processs; Process-models; Robotized thermal spray process; Thermal spray process; Process engineering,,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: RGPIN-2020-03956; China Scholarship Council, CSC: CSC 201808180001",The authors would like to acknowledge the China Scholarship Council (CSC 201808180001) and NSERC Discovery Grant (RGPIN-2020-03956) support.,,"Tao, F., Qi, Q., Wang, L., Nee, A.Y.C., Digital Twins and Cyber-Physical Systems toward Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: Correlation and Comparison (2019) Engineering., 5 (4), pp. 653-661; Tao, F., Zhang, H.E., Liu, A., Nee, A.Y.C., Digital Twin in Industry: State-of-the-Art (2019) IEEE Trans.

On the other hand, the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has equipped buildings with an ability to learn. A lot of research has been dedicated to specific machine learning applications for specific phases of a building's life-cycle. The reviews commonly take a specific, technological perspective without a vision for the integration of smart technologies at the level of the whole system. Especially, there is a lack of discussion on the roles of autonomous AI agents and training environments for boosting the learning process in complex and abruptly changing operational environments. This review article discusses the learning ability of buildings with a system-level perspective and presents an overview of autonomous machine learning applications that make independent decisions for building energy management. We conclude that the buildings’ adaptability to unpredicted changes can be enhanced at the system level through AI-initiated learning processes and by using digital twins as training environments. The greatest potential for energy efficiency improvement is achieved by integrating adaptability solutions at the timescales of HVAC control and electricity market participation. © 2021 The Authors",Energy efficiency; HVAC; Intelligent building; Learning; Reinforcement learning; Smart building,Autonomous agents; Climate change; Energy management; HVAC; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Reinforcement learning; Sustainable development; Building integrated; Building life cycle; Integrated energy systems; Learn+; Learning; Learning process; Machine learning applications; Operational environments; System levels; Technological perspective; Energy efficiency,,,,,,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",,"Aduda, K.O., Labeodan, T., Zeiler, W., Boxem, G., Demand side flexibility coordination in office buildings: A framework and case study application (2017) Sustainable Cities and Society, 29, pp. 139-158; Agouzoul, A., Tabaa, M., Chegari, B., Simeu, E., Dandache, A., Alami, K., Towards a Digital Twin model for Building Energy Management: Case of Morocco (2021) Procedia Computer Science, 184, pp. 404-410; Aguilar, J., Garces-Jimenez, A., R-Moreno, M.S., García, R., A systematic literature review on the use of artificial intelligence in energy self-management in smart buildings (2021) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 151; Al Dakheel, J., Del Pero, C., Aste, N., Leonforte, F., Smart buildings features and key performance indicators: A review (2020) Sustainable Cities and Society, 61; Alanne, K., A novel performance indicator for the assessment of the learning ability of smart buildings (2021) Sustainable Cities and Society, 72; Alawadi, S., Mera, D., Fernández-Delgado, M., Alkhabbas, F., Olsson, C.M., Davidsson, P., A comparison of machine learning algorithms for forecasting indoor temperature in smart buildings (2020) Energy Systems; Albino, V., Berardi, U., Dangelico, R.M., Smart cities: Definitions, dimensions, performance, and initiatives (2015) Journal of Urban Technology, 22 (1), pp. 3-21; Amayri, M., Ploix, S., Bouguila, N., Wurtz, F., Database quality assessment for interactive learning: Application to occupancy estimation (2020) Energy and Buildings, 209; Angjeliu, G., Coronelli, D., Cardani, G., Development of the simulation model for Digital Twin applications in historical masonry buildings: The integration between numerical and experimental reality (2020) Computers & Structures, 238; Araya, D.B., Grolinger, K., El Yamany, H.F., Capretz, M.A.M., Bitsuamlak, G., An ensemble learning framework for anomaly detection in building energy consumption (2017) Energy and Buildings, 144, pp. 191-206; Argyris, C., Schön, D.A., Organizational learning: A theory of action perspective (1978), Addison-Wesley Reading, MA; Azuatalam, D., Lee, W.-L., de Nijs, F., Liebman, A., Reinforcement learning for whole-building HVAC control and demand response (2020) Energy and AI, 2; Badue, C., Guidolini, R., Carneiro, R.V., Azevedo, P., Cardoso, V.B., Forechi, A., De Souza, A.F., Self-driving cars: A survey (2021) Expert Systems with Applications, 165; Bailey, L., Classifying smart buildings: A guide to four levels of smart (2020) WorkTech Academy Newsletter, , https://www.worktechacademy.com/classifying-smart-buildings-four-levels-of-smart/, Retrieved from; Batov, E.I., The Distinctive Features of “Smart” Buildings (2015) Procedia Engineering, 111, pp. 103-107; Bloom, B.S., Engelhart, M.D., Furst, E.J., Hill, W.H., Krathwohl, D.R., Taxonomy of educational objectives: The classification of educational goals; handbook I: Cognitive domain new york (1956), Longmans, Green New York; Boje, C., Guerriero, A., Kubicki, S., Rezgui, Y., Towards a semantic Construction Digital Twin: Directions for future research (2020) Automation in Construction, 114; Bołtuć, P., Consciousness for AGI (2020) Procedia Computer Science, 169, pp. 365-372; Brandi, S., Piscitelli, M.S., Martellacci, M., Capozzoli, A., Deep reinforcement learning to optimise indoor temperature control and heating energy consumption in buildings (2020) Energy and Buildings, 224; Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., OpenAI gym (2016); Candanedo, L.M., Feldheim, V., Deramaix, D., Reconstruction of the indoor temperature dataset of a house using data driven models for performance evaluation (2018) Building and Environment, 138, pp. 250-261; Cao, L., Li, Y., Zhang, J., Jiang, Y., Han, Y., Wei, J., Electrical load prediction of healthcare buildings through single and ensemble learning (2020) Energy Reports, 6, pp. 2751-2767; Carreira, P., Costa, A.A., Mansur, V., Arsénio, A., Can HVAC really learn from users?

This paper is motivated by the fact that practical IESs suffer from multiple uncertainty sources, and complicated surrounding environment. To address this problem, a novel DT-based day-ahead scheduling method is proposed. The physical IES is modelled as a multi-vector energy system in its virtual space that interacts with the physical IES to manipulate its operations. A deep neural network is trained to make statistical cost-saving scheduling by learning from both historical forecasting errors and day-ahead forecasts. Case studies of IESs show that the proposed DT-based method is able to reduce the operating cost of IES by 63.5%, comparing to the existing forecast-based scheduling methods. It is also found that both electric vehicles and thermal energy storages play proactive roles in the proposed method, highlighting their importance in future energy system integration and decarbonisation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Digital twins; Integrated energy system; Machine learning; Multi-vector energy system,Cost reduction; Deep neural networks; E-learning; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Scheduling; Cost saving; Day-ahead; Energy systems; Integrated energy systems; Multi-vector energy system; Renewable energies; Scheduling methods; System scheduling; Uncertainty; Under loads; Forecasting; alternative energy; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; integrated approach; uncertainty analysis,,,,,"Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK Government, BEIS","This work was supported by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS), UK through the project of “Ubiquitous Storage Empowering Response (USER)” https://www.theuserproject.co.uk/ .",,"Skarvelis-Kazakos, S., Papadopoulos, P., Grau Unda, I., Gorman, T., Belaidi, A., Zigan, S., Multiple energy carrier optimisation with intelligent agents (2016) Appl Energy, 167, pp. 323-335; Wang, H., Gu, C., Zhang, X., Li, F., Optimal CHP planning in integrated energy systems considering network charges (2020) IEEE Syst J, 14 (2), pp. 2684-2693; Moeini-Aghtaie, M., Dehghanian, P., Fotuhi-Firuzabad, M., Abbaspour, A., Multiagent genetic algorithm: an online probabilistic view on economic dispatch of energy hubs constrained by wind availability (2014) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 5 (2), pp. 699-708; Darbali-Zamora, R., Johnson, J., Summers, A., Jones, C.B., Hansen, C., Showalter, C., State estimation-based distributed energy resource optimization for distribution voltage regulation in telemetry-sparse environments using a real-time digital twin (2021) Energies, 14 (3); Barricelli, B.R., Casiraghi, E., Fogli, D., A survey on digital twin: Definitions, characteristics, applications, and design implications (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 167653-167671; Balancing mechanism reporting service (2020), https://www.bmreports.com/, URL:; [Accessed 21 2020]; Xiang, Y., Cai, H., Gu, C., Shen, X., Cost–benefit analysis of integrated energy system planning considering demand response (2020) Energy, 192; Future energy scenarios 2019 documents (2020), http://fes.nationalgrid.com/fes-document/, URL:; [Accessed 21 2020]; Ge, S., Xu, Z., Liu, H., Gu, C., Li, F., Flexibility evaluation of active distribution networks considering probabilistic characteristics of uncertain variables (2019) IET Gener Trans Distrib, 13 (14), pp. 3148-3157; Liu, F., Bie, Z., Wang, X., Day-ahead dispatch of integrated electricity and natural gas system considering reserve scheduling and renewable uncertainties (2018) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 10 (2), pp. 646-658; Salkuti, S.R., Day-ahead thermal and renewable power generation scheduling considering uncertainty (2019) Renew Energy, 131, pp. 956-965; Fan, C., Wang, J., Gang, W., Li, S., Assessment of deep recurrent neural network-based strategies for short-term building energy predictions (2019) Appl Energy, 236, pp. 700-710; Theocharides, S., Makrides, G., Livera, A., Theristis, M., Kaimakis, P., Georghiou, G.E., Day-ahead photovoltaic power production forecasting methodology based on machine learning and statistical post-processing (2020) Appl Energy, 268; Zhu, C., Tian, W., Yin, B., Li, Z., Shi, J., Uncertainty calibration of building energy models by combining approximate bayesian computation and machine learning algorithms (2020) Appl Energy, 268; Zhang, L., Wen, J., Li, Y., Chen, J., Ye, Y., Fu, Y., A review of machine learning in building load prediction (2021) Appl Energy, 285; Teo, T., Logenthiran, T., Woo, W.L., Abidi, K., (2018), pp. 1257-1261. , Near-optimal day-ahead scheduling of energy storage system in grid-connected microgrid.

DTs in buildings can be regarded as an expression of “BIM+,” born to digital descriptions. Comprehensive perception of physical systems is the preconditions for DTs implementation. BIM's energy-saving design includes the selection of building orientation and building shape. BIM energy consumption analysis can compare different materials, examine the performance of various materials, and select the most suitable and most energy-efficient materials for building structure maintenance. Data Fusion Algorithm (DFA) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is improved. A novel DFA is constructed by combining Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) with Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DCHP), recorded as BP-DCHP. Simulation experiment proves that BP-DCHP can prolong sensor nodes’ survival time and provide the highest data fusion quality. BP-DCHP runs for about 310 s, 500 s, and 705 s in WSNs consisting of 20, 50, and 100 WSNs, respectively. Moreover, BP-DCHP can provide higher quality given insufficient data fusion degree. Once the WSNs consume 50% of the total initial energy, BP-DCHP presents a shorter network delay, only 0.6 s on average in the 100-sensor-node-WSN. To validate BDTs’ effectiveness, the environmental satisfaction of residents from two Beijing intelligent communities is assessed using Deep Learning (DL) approach. Taking the data as the clue, the study establishes DTs serving the application of urban scene, which plays a certain role in promoting the technological innovation of BDTs, better optimizing the city and managing the city. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Assessment of environmental satisfaction; BIM big data; Building digital twins; Deep learning; Energy efficient building,Architectural design; Data fusion; Deep learning; E-learning; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Neural networks; Sensor nodes; Assessment of environmental satisfaction; Building digital twin; Building information model big data; Building Information Modelling; Data fusion algorithm; Deep learning; Dynamic host configuration protocols; Energy efficient building; In-buildings; Protocol cans; Big data,,,,,"KF-2019-04-010; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China, MNR; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 41801392, 41971341, 41971354; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province: 2019A1515010748, 2019A1515011872, 2021A1515011324","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41971341, 41971354, 41801392), General Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2019A1515010748, 2019A1515011872, 2021A1515011324), the Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, MNR(No .KF-2019-04-010).","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41971341, 41971354, 41801392), General Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2019A1515010748, 2019A1515011872, 2021A1515011324), the Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, MNR(No.KF-2019-04-010).","Madni, A.M., Madni, C.C., Lucero, S.D., Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering (2019) Systems, 7, p. 7; Qiu, J., Chai, Y., Tian, Z., Automatic concept extraction based on semantic graphs from big data in smart city (2019) IEEE Trans Comput Social Syst, 7, pp. 225-233; Qiu, J., Tian, Z., Du, C., A survey on access control in the age of internet of things (2020) IEEE Internet Things J, 7, pp. 4682-4696; Jiang, H., Qin, S., Fu, J., How to model and implement connections between physical and virtual models for digital twin application (2021) J Manuf Syst, 58, pp. 36-51; He, Y., Guo, J., Zheng, X., From surveillance to digital twin: Challenges and recent advances of signal processing for industrial internet of things (2018) IEEE Signal Process Mag, 35, pp. 120-129; Lu, Q., Parlikad, A.K., Woodall, P., Developing a digital twin at building and city levels: case study of West Cambridge campus (2020) J Manage Eng, 36, p. 05020004; Zheng, X., Cai, Z., Privacy-preserved data sharing towards multiple parties in industrial IoTs (2020) IEEE J Sel Areas Commun, 38, pp. 968-979; Kaewunruen, S., Rungskunroch, P., Welsh, J., A digital-twin evaluation of net zero energy building for existing buildings (2019) Sustainability, 11, p. 159; Privara, S., Široký, J., Ferkl, L., Model predictive control of a building heating system: The first experience (2011) Energy Build, 43, pp. 564-572; Corbin, C.D., Henze, G.P., May-Ostendorp, P., A model predictive control optimization environment for real-time commercial building application (2013) J Build Perform Simul, 6, pp. 159-174; Minerva, R., Lee, G.M., Crespi, N., Digital twin in the IoT context: a survey on technical features, scenarios, and architectural models (2020) Proc IEEE, 108 (2020), pp. 1785-1824; Kong, T., Hu, T., Zhou, T., Data construction method for the applications of workshop digital twin system (2021) J Manuf Syst, 58, pp. 323-328; Sepasgozar, S.M.E., Digital twin and web-based virtual gaming technologies for online education: A case of construction management and engineering (2020) Appl Sci, 10, p. 4678; Arrichiello, V., Gualeni, P., Systems engineering and digital twin: a vision for the future of cruise ships design, production and operations (2020) Int J Interact Des Manuf (IJIDeM), 14, pp. 115-122; Glatt, M., Sinnwell, C., Yi, L., Modeling and implementation of a digital twin of material flows based on physics simulation (2021) J Manuf Syst, 58, pp. 231-245; Kunath, M., Winkler, H., Integrating the Digital Twin of the manufacturing system into a decision support system for improving the order management process (2018) Procedia Cirp, 72, pp. 225-231; Zohdi, T.I., A machine-learning framework for rapid adaptive digital-twin based fire-propagation simulation in complex environments.

These days, many existing urban building energy models (UBEM) use the non-geo-specified 3D building stock geometries or the digital twins of cities as their primary input for energy simulation. The digital twins of cities or the built environment is an accurate scale virtual representation (geo-specified geometry and information) of city objects enabled to be paired with dynamic predictive models of their energy performance. The use of built environment digital twins for their energy assessment works well for those cities whose digital twin datasets are readily available for public or private use. In the cities without digital twin datasets, their energy assessment is limited by tools that use 2D building stock footprints as their primary input or apply a top-down urban energy simulation approach. This gap motivated the current research to identify an extended UBEM data preparation workflow focused on generating city digital twins using accessible GIS datasets as well as national and local data sources. The workflow is majorly developed to deal with GIS data processing utilizing multilevel spatial data integration and refinement to fill in the recognized inconsistencies of building databases. Then, procedural 3D city modelling and an automated transformation to a semantic, CityGML format are successfully provided to generate digital twin of the study area in an open data model. The archetype modelling method is also employed to create a set of customized housing energy profiles to support tailored bottom-up UBEM and retrofitting scenarios relying on the simulation platform Insel4Cities, under development at Concordia University. The workflow was practically carried out on a case study, Kelowna city in British Columbia (BC)/Canada, to validate the district heating load. The average simulated heating energy use intensity showed a deviation of less than 2.5% from the BC measured data. As an example of workflow usability, the developed model was also utilized to assess a retrofit scenario, combining a decentralized heat pump and photovoltaic system, to present the district's potential for net-zero action planning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Archetype characterization; CityGML; Insel4Cities; UBEM data preparation; Urban Building Energy Modelling (UBEM),Data integration; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Geographic information systems; Housing; Metadata; Open Data; Photovoltaic cells; Retrofitting; Semantics; Simulation platform; Archetype characterization; Building energy model; CityGML; Data preparation; Insel4city; Modeling data; Urban building energy modeling; Urban building energy modeling data preparation; Urban buildings; 3D modeling,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 730254; Natural Resources Canada, NRCan; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Horizon 2020","This research was undertaken, in part, thanks to funding from the Canada Excellence Research Chair Program, a Tri-Agency funding program.

With the development of digital twin, building the physical-virtual data space for improving energy management capacity of enterprises has received tremendous attention. The energy behaviour model implementing accurate simulation and prediction of energy state is the core meta-model of energy-efficient manufacturing digital twin (EMDT). The widely used state-based energy modelling assumes constant power in operation state and approximately fits the energy behaviour without considering uncertain operation environment, resulting in energy behaviour distortion. A data-driven hybrid petri-net (DDHPN) inspired by both the state-based energy modelling and machine learning was developed for establishing the energy behaviour meta-model. Gaussian kernel extreme learning machine is proposed to fit the instantaneous firing speed of energy consumption continuous transitions in DDHPN. DDHPN-based energy behaviour model is driven by physical data under real-time working conditions, operating parameters, and production load for generating a virtual data space of energy management. Finally, DDHPN was integrated into the EMDT model using unified modelling language. The application in extrusion process and die casting process show that the presented model has higher accuracy in energy behaviour prediction. Furthermore, a digital-twin-based energy management prototype system for extrusion workshop demonstrates its potential. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Data-driven hybrid petri-net; Digital twin; Energy behaviour modelling;

BOX 237, Helsinki, 00530, Finland","The building’s digital twin has been proposed as a solution for solving significant challenges in various areas of the built environment, especially the facility management (FM) one. There are already some commercial solutions on the market that vendors call digital twins, and several researchers have presented their proposals. Those are different in terms of use, content, and technical implementation, as nowadays a comprehensive definition does not exist. Most of the presented solutions are vendor and software dependent, and usually, they are offering a mere 3D graphical user interface (GUI) visualizing spaces and conditions. Although those can help a facility engineer monitor an asset’s performance, they are not real digital twins. This chapter intends to define the digital twin’s vision and show how to utilize it in facility management. Thus, the requirements on specifications for building information modeling (BIM) and field data are presented. Finally, it is shown how the introduction of a digital twin revolutionizes buildings’ maintenance and the management of energy efficiency and indoor conditions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conditions management; Digital twin; Energy management; Facility management; Internet of things; Wireless sensors,,,,,,,,,"Al-Ali, A.R., Gupta, R., Al Nabulsi, A., Cyber physical systems role in manufacturing technologies (2018) AIP Conference Proceedings, Vol. 1957(1), pp. 1-7. , . pp; Dawkins, O., Hudson-Smith, A., Dennet, A., (2018) Living with a Digital Twin: Operational Management and Engagement Using Iot and Mixed Realities at UCL’s Here East Campus on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, , UK; Halmetoja, E., Forns-Samso, F., Evaluating graphical user interfaces for buildings (2020) J.

The demonstrated shading system design meets all the necessary requirements for comfort conditions in the space, that include efficiency of shading for mitigation of harmful (excessive) solar gains (that may lead to space overheating and increase in cooling loads) and acceptable amount of useful light entering the space. To design such static shading authors followed several crucial steps that are discussed in detail. The steps are further summarized in a design workflow. The shading is validated to ensure comfortable thermal conditions and visual comfort inside the space under investigation by the use of specific software. The importance of introduction of digital twin technology to the passive energy-efficient design of buildings by means of passive control of thermal and visual conditions with the use of shading systems is as well discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Daylight; Digital twin; Energy efficiency; IESVE; Shading design; Solar control; Visual conditions improvement,Architectural design; Digital twin; Solar buildings; Systems analysis; Comfort conditions; Design workflow; Envelope designs; Passive control; Passive energy; Shading systems; Thermal condition; Visual condition; Energy efficiency,,,,,"075-15-2020-934; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka",Acknowledgements The research is partially funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation as part of World-class Research Center program: Advanced Digital Technologies (contract No. 075-15-2020-934 dated 17.11.2020).,,"Andrianova, M.J., Vorobjev, K.V., Lednova, J.A., Chusov, A.N., A shortterm model experiment of organic pollutants treatment with aquatic macrophytes in industrial and municipal waste waters (2014) Appl Mech Mater, 587-589, pp. 653-656; Bondarenko, E.A., Il’Ina, K.H., Andrianova, M., Chusov, A.N., Main inorganic ions and electric conductivity of polluted urban streams (2017) Mag Civil Eng, 68 (8), pp. 37-44. , https://doi.org/10.5862/MCE.68.4; Andrianova, M.J., Bondarenko, E.A., Krotova, E.O., Chusov, A.N., Comparison of chemical and optical parameters in monitoring of urban river Okhta.

For this reason and following a digital twin strategy, an online data-driven energy modeling approach with adaptive capabilities has been proposed and described throughout this paper. This approach is useful in developing robust energy management systems that enhance the energy efficiency of industrial machinery. In this way, the dynamic behavior of their energy consumption is modeled without using phenomenological laws. In contrast, traditional methodologies hardly consider such dynamic behavior or use an exhaustive modeling process. The proposed approach includes an adaptive mechanism to consider the natural degradation of machinery. This mechanism is based on a concept drift detector, which detects when the current consumption of the machine is not correctly represented by the model estimation and adapts the model to account for these new behaviors. The concept drift detector has broad applicability in the face of reducing maintenance costs, measuring the impact and evolution of either abnormal behaviors (e.g., failures) or degradation, and identify which elements change. The proposed methodology has been validated in an industrial testbed. An experiment with three emulated concept drifts was carried out in the testbed. As a result, the proposed adaptive approach obtained more than doubled the fit rate of the energy prediction/estimation compared to the non-adaptive model and successfully detected these changes in energy consumption. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Concept drift; Data-driven model; Digital twin; Energy efficiency; Energy models; Gaussian mixture models; Machine fault diagnosis; Non-intrusive load monitoring; Subspace identification,Dynamics; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Machinery; Manufacture; Testbeds; Concept drifts; Data driven; Data driven modelling; Energy; Energy modelling; Energy-consumption; Gaussian mixture modeling; Machine fault diagnosis; Nonintrusive load monitoring; Subspace identification; Energy efficiency,,,,,Generalitat de Catalunya: 2019 DI 4,"This work has been supported by the Doctorats Industrials program from the Catalan Government ( 2019 DI 4 ).

Smart buildings rely on the sensor networks and Internet of Things (IoT), which allows the development and optimization performance through various methods, including efficient energy management solutions and predictive technologies for future decisions. Smart buildings generate data in real-time, and human-based choices are often taken in real-time. IoT provides connectivity for the various sensors. Smart buildings must ensure the proper operation with minimum time and energy with regards to dynamic human demands and performance in real-time. Blockchain technology can ensure data integrity and regulated autonomous flow of information between users who have a varying degree of trust. Therefore, the combination of Blockchain and the IoT can achieve data integrity between IoT devices installed in the smart buildings where multiple humans are involved and have different non-overlapping expectations from the building’s environment and response. In this paper, a set of predictive technologies are analyzed, and their common parameters are shown to affect the possible prediction and visualization of the IoT data for users. A digital twin based on Blockchain is proposed where individual users owing some sensors can use and visualize processed data based on rules set by the owners in the Blockchain. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Blockchain; Digital twin; Internet of Things; Predictive analysis; Smart building,,,,,,,,,"Smart building market-growth, trends, forecasts (2020-2025).

Container orchestration platforms have emerged to alleviate this problem with prior art either using heuristics to quickly reach scheduling decisions or AI driven methods like reinforcement learning and evolutionary approaches to adapt to dynamic scenarios. The former often fail to quickly adapt in highly dynamic environments, whereas the latter have run-times that are slow enough to negatively impact response time. Therefore, there is a need for scheduling policies that are both reactive to work efficiently in volatile environments and have low scheduling overheads. To achieve this, we propose a Gradient Based Optimization Strategy using Back-propagation of gradients with respect to Input (GOBI). Further, we leverage the accuracy of predictive digital-twin models and simulation capabilities by developing a Coupled Simulation and Container Orchestration Framework (COSCO). Using this, we create a hybrid simulation driven decision approach, GOBI*, to optimize Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Co-simulation and the back-propagation approaches allow these methods to adapt quickly in volatile environments. Experiments conducted using real-world data on fog applications using the GOBI and GOBI∗ methods, show a significant improvement in terms of energy consumption, response time, Service Level Objective and scheduling time by up to 15, 40, 4, and 82 percent respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. © 1990-2012 IEEE.",back-propagation to input; container orchestration; coupled simulation; Fog computing; QoS optimization,Backpropagation; Containers; Energy utilization; Fog; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Predictive analytics; Quality of service; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling; Computing environments; Evolutionary approach; Gradient-based optimization; Low energy consumption; Quality of Service parameters; Service Level Agreements; State-of-the-art algorithms; Volatile environments; Fog computing,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 825040; Imperial College London; European Social Fund, ESF",The work of Shreshth Tuli was supported by the Imperial College London through the President's Ph.D. Scholarship Scheme.

Changes in daily routines created changes in water consumption patterns. Significant changes in water demands can affect the operation of water distribution systems, resulting in new patterns of flow, with implications for water age, pressure, and energy consumption. This research develops a digital twin to couple Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data with a hydraulic model to assess impacts on infrastructure due to changes in water demands associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for a case study. Using 2019 and COVID-19 modeling scenarios, the hydraulic model was executed to evaluate changes to water quality based on water age, pressure across nodes in the network, and the energy required by the system to distribute potable water. A water supply interruption event was modeled as a water main break to assess network resiliency for 2019 and COVID-19 demands. A digital twin provides the capabilities to explore and visualize emerging consumption patterns and their effects on the functioning of water systems, providing valuable analyses for water utility managers and insight for optimizing infrastructure operations and planning for long-term impacts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",COVID-19; Digital twin; Multi-modal failure; Resilience; Water demand; Water distribution systems,Advanced metering infrastructures; Energy utilization; Hydraulic models; Potable water; Water distribution systems; Water quality; Water supply; Consumption patterns; Coronavirus disease 2019; Coronaviruses; Daily routines; Multi-modal; Multi-modal failure; Resilience; Water ages; Water demand; Water infrastructure; Coronavirus,,,,,"King Abdulaziz University, KAU; Secretaría de Educación Superior, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación, SENESCYT; Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission, SACM","The authors would like to thank the City of Lakewood for collaborating on this project and providing information and data.

The sharp increase in changing customer demands has resulted in factories transitioning rapidly and yielding shorter product life cycles. Traditional modeling and simulation approaches are not suited to handle such scenarios. As a possible solution, we propose a generic data-driven framework for automated generation of simulation models as basis for digital twins for smart factories. The novelty of our proposed framework is in the data-driven approach that exploits advancements in machine learning and process mining techniques, as well as continuous model improvement and validation. The goal of the framework is to minimize and fully define, or even eliminate, the need for expert knowledge in the extraction of the corresponding simulation models. We illustrate our framework through a case study. © 2021 The Author(s)",Data-driven; Digital twin; Machine learning; Process mining; Reconfigurable manufacturing; Smart factory,Data mining; E-learning; Energy utilization; Life cycle; Manufacture; Real time systems; % reductions; Data driven; Energy-consumption; Increased productivity; Process mining; Real- time; Reconfigurable manufacturing; Simulation model; Smart factory; Smart manufacturing; Machine learning,,,,,,,,"Aheleroff, S., Xu, X., Zhong, R.Y., Lu, Y., Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) in Industry 4.0: an Architecture Reference Model (2021) Adv.

Responding to this interest partly involves addressing challenges related to building stock data collection and processing. The present study, carried out in conjunction with Natural Resources Canada's Canadian Energy End-use Mapping (CEE Map) project, aims to develop the inputs for housing energy modeling and mapping using property assessment data, building, heating permit data, and smart thermostat data. In this context, a systematic workflow is presented to extract useful information from various data sources to support housing energy simulations and municipal retrofit program planning. Permit data analysis supported refinement of housing data in Kelowna's urban digital twin. Results from building permit data analysis serve to update housing attributes including construction year and dwelling type. Results from heating permit analysis suggest that 17.5% of Kelowna dwellings could be potential candidates for heating system upgrades. Regarding thermostat setpoint temperature and occupancy for energy simulations, results obtained from smart thermostat data analysis were compared with EnerGuide Rating System (ERS) assumptions to investigate the potential improvements that can be made in energy simulation inputs. Comparative results indicated variations of up to 2 °C between smart thermostat data and EnerGuide assumptions for thermostat setpoint temperatures. Also, smart thermostat data suggests that 87% of dwellings were occupied for more than 50% of the time, whereas in ERS, occupancy is assumed to be 50%. Together, the overall data workflow and the detailed investigation of different datasets contributes to the development of a best practice methodology for housing energy modeling and mapping for municipalities in support of GHG emission reductions. Further, recommendations for permit data collection and scope for future research works are provided. © 2021",Building and heating permits; Energy mapping; Municipal housing retrofit program planning; Simulation inputs; Smart thermostat data; Systematic workflow,Data acquisition; Data handling; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Information analysis; Mapping; Retrofitting; Thermostats; Building and heating permit; Energy; Energy mapping; Municipal housing retrofit program planning; Program planning; Retrofit programs; Simulation input; Smart thermostat data; Systematic workflow; Work-flows; Housing,,,,,"3000702812; Canada Excellence Research Chairs, Government of Canada, CERC: CERC-2018-00005","The research reported in this study was supported by Natural Resources Canada's Innovation Fund and CanmetENERGY-Ottawa under contract number 3000702812 and the Canada Excellence Research Chairs Program (CERC-2018-00005), funded by the Tri-Agency Institutional Program Secretariat.

In particular, camera-based lane detection plays an essential role in autonomous vehicle trajectory planning. However, lane detection is subject to high complexity, and it is sensitive to illumination variation, appearance, and age of lane marking. In addition, the sheer infinite number of test cases for highly automated vehicles requires an increasing portion of test and validation to be performed in simulation and X-in-the-loop testing. To model the complexity of camera-based lane detection, physical models are often used, which consider the optical properties of the imager as well as image processing itself. This complexity results in high efforts for the simulation in terms of modelling as well as computational costs. This paper presents a Phenomenological Lane Detection Model (PLDM) to simulate camera performance. The innovation of the approach is the modelling technique using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is a class of Neural Network (NN). In order to prepare input data for our neural network model, massive driving tests have been performed on the M86 highway road in Hungary. The model’s inputs include vehicle dynamics signals (such as speed and acceleration, etc.). In addition, the difference between the reference output from the digital-twin map of the highway and camera lane detection results is considered as the target of the NN. The network consists of four hidden layers, and scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation is used for training the network. The results demonstrate that PLDM can sufficiently replicate camera detection performance in the simulation. The modelling approach improves the realism of camera sensor simulation as well as computational effort for X-in-the-loop applications and thereby supports safety validation of camera-based functionality in automated driving, which decreases the energy consumption of vehicles. © 2021 by the authors.

This research paper analyzes the potential benefit of a novel three-phase dual system power inverter over the conventional inverter used in a solar power plant. The concept of such a power inverter is explained, and the digital twin model is created in a MATLAB Simulink environment. The efficiency characteristic of the simulated inverter is compared to the efficiency characteristic of a real conventional inverter. A standalone data logging system and an additional data acquisition system were used to collect and process data from the real inverter. Comparison of the digital twin inverter and the real conventional inverter shows the potential benefit of this novel inverter technology. It is shown that the novel inverter can operate in a wider range of DC input power. The potential economic benefit is also presented and discussed in the paper. © 2021 by the authors.

In this way, responsible consumption and production systems can be designed and the system’s parameters can be tuned via DT. In this study, the model of a servomotor system that is used for industrial purposes is experimentally obtained. This study consists of two steps. In the first step, within the embedded control of the system, position and velocity control loops are deactivated. Then through the servo driver, currents with sinusoidal waveforms at various frequencies are applied to the servomotor. The resultant angular velocity of the motor is monitored and recorded. The amplitude of the current is kept constant during this study. The frequency of the current, however, is increased logarithmically. By using these data, a first-order transfer function (TF) is identified for the motor model. In the second step, all control loops are activated. Consequently, the total servomotor system could be represented in a digital environment. Furthermore, the static friction issue is overcome by using a Coulomb friction model with stiction effect. Finally, several experiments are conducted and then results are compared with the digital model of the servomotor system. The results clearly show that digital model can fairly represent the physical system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Coulomb friction model; Responsible consumption and production; Servo system; Static friction; Stiction effect; Transfer function,Energy utilization; Scattering parameters; Transfer functions; Tribology; 'current; Control loop; Coulomb friction models; Digital modeling; Responsible consumption and production; Servo driver; Servo-motor; Servo-systems; Static friction; Stiction effect; Stiction,,,,,"Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu, TÜBITAK: 116M272","Acknowledgments.

The Paris Agreement sets out a global framework for sustainable development performance configuring all climate action related policies. Fast control of CO2 emissions necessarily involves cities since they are responsible for 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. A common framework for urban policy impact assessment must be based on architectural design tools and common data repositories for standard digital building models. Many Neighbourhood Sustainability Assessment (NSA) tools have been developed but the growing availability of open data repositories for cities, together with big-data sources (provided through Internet of Things repositories), allow accurate neighbourhood simulations, or in other words, digital twins of neighbourhoods. These digital twins are excellent tools for policy impact assessment. This chapter provides a generic approach for a simple neighbourhood model developed from building physical parameters which meets relevant assessment requirements. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Energy simulation; Neighbourhood digital model; Sustainability assessment,Carbon footprint; Climate change; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Open Data; Sustainable development; Data repositories; Development performance; Digital modeling; Energy simulation; Fast control; Impact assessments; Model of energy consumption; Neighborhood digital model; Neighbourhood; Sustainability assessment; Greenhouse gases,,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Building Technologies Office, BTO","OS software uses the EnergyPlus (E+) engine to simulate the energy demand.

Alongside efforts to offer optimum solutions through plant design and sizing, it is also necessary to develop a flexible virtualised replica of renewable hydrogen plants, that not only models compatibility with the “plug-and-play” nature of many facilities, but that also identifies key elements for optimisation of system operation. This study presents a model for a renewable hydrogen production plant based on real-time historical and present-day datasets of PV connected to a virtualised grid-connected AC microgrid comprising different technologies of batteries, electrolysers, and fuel cells. Mathematical models for each technology were developed from chemical and physical metrics of the plant. The virtualised replica is the first step toward the implementation of a digital twin of the system, and accurate validation of the system behaviour when updated with real-time data. As a case study, a solar hydrogen pilot plant consisting of a 60 kW Solar PV, a 40 kW PEM electrolyser, a 15 kW LIB battery and a 5 kW PEM fuel cell were simulated and analysed. Two effective operational factors on the plant's performance are defined: (i) electrolyser power settings to determine appropriate hydrogen production over twilight periods and/or overnight and (ii) a user-defined minimum threshold for battery state of charge to prevent charge depletion overnight if the electrolyser load is higher than its capacity. The objective of this modelling is to maximise hydrogen yield while both loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and microgrid excess power are minimised. This analysis determined: (i) a hydrogen yield of 38–39% from solar DC energy to hydrogen energy produced, (ii) an LPSP &lt;2.6 × 10−4 and (iii) &lt; 2% renewable energy lost to the grid as excess electricity for the case study. © 2021 The Author(s)",Analytical model; Operational aspect; Renewable hydrogen; Replica simulation,Analytical models; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Pilot plants; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solar power generation; Case-studies; Electrolysers; Hydrogen plants; Hydrogen yields; Loss of power supply probability; Microgrid; Operational aspects; Renewable hydrogens; Replica simulation; Solar hydrogen; Hydrogen production,,,,,"2018/RND012; Queensland University of Technology, QUT; Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA","This activity received funding from Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) as part of ARENA's Research and Development Program - Renewable Hydrogen for Export (Contract No. 2018/RND012 ).

In addition, recent market tendencies show a desire to reduce waste and for longer designed life. One major strategy used to meet these trends is the utilization of a digital twin. Digital twins are numerical analogues to physical systems such as aircraft, auto-mobiles, and power generation systems. With the wide applicability of the digital twin, an understanding of their development can give insight into the impact and direction of recent research. Understanding these advancements can also give confidence in both the technique of using a digital twin and the simulated predictions to various loading conditions. This chapter focuses on detailing the historical development of digital twins to the state-of-the-art research being done and specifically how it is relevant to the structural dynamics community. © 2022, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.",,Dynamics; Design engineers; Digital simulation; Digital testing; Historical perspective; Market tendencies; Numerical analogs; Performance computing; Physical systems; Power generation systems; Recent researches; Structural dynamics,,,,,,,,"Rosen, R., von Wichert, G., Lo, G., Bettenhausen, K.D.: About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing.

In this regard, digitalization is disrupting the wind section thanks to the development of advanced sensors, automated equipment, computational power, among other. All these allow to optimize and simplify different parts of the offshore wind power plant development (i.e. design, planning, installation, O&M, etc.). This fact is of special interest on maintenance, since the early detection of failures or malfunctions lead to reduced costly corrective maintenance. This paper presents a literature review of current state-of-the-art on the application of digitalization activities which can be applied for floating wind, including typical component failures, monitoring techniques and advanced digital tools as Digital Twin concept and Building Information Models (BIM). Finally, the review paper provides an analysis of existing gaps, needs and challenges of the sector to provide guides on research and innovation to foster offshore wind sector. © 2021 The Author(s)",BIM; Digital Twin; Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT); Monitoring; Reliability; Sensors,Architectural design; Chemical detection; Corrective maintenance; Digital devices; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind turbines; Advanced sensors; Automated equipment; Building Information Modelling; Computational power; Digital tools; Floating offshore wind turbine; Floating offshore wind turbines; Offshore wind power plants; Offshore winds; State of the art; Wind power,,,,,815083,"We would like to thank Marie-Antoinette Schwarzkopf, Friedemann Borisade, Moritz Werther H?ckell and Dhaval Gambhava from Ramboll Group, Germany, for assistance with the paper review and for the comments that greatly improved the manuscript.

In a physics-based approach, the full three-dimensional behavior of the bridge is represented using response functions and distribution factors. In contrast to conventional finite-element analysis, this approach focuses on the relationship between the applied loads and the measured responses, given the limitations on the information about the applied loads due to random passing traffic. At the same time, it takes advantage of some key features of bridge traffic loading that are consistent, regardless of the weights of the passing vehicles. The nature of traffic loading is that axles travel from one end of a bridge to the other and the response is a linear combination of axle weights and ordinates of the same influence line function, adjusted for relative axle locations. Small/medium span concrete slab-girder decks are the target structures of the study. The three-dimensional nature of such structures is a particular challenge, especially in the case of multiple vehicle presence. While these bridges are strongly orthotropic, there is a significant degree of load distribution between the girders immediately under the passing vehicle and girders under adjacent lanes. This is addressed using an iterative approach that uses transverse distribution factors. The proposed DT model is verified using both numerical simulation and field tests. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Axle weight; Digital twin; Influence line; Multiple presence; Response function; Signal separation; Transverse load distribution,Axles; Concrete slabs; Distribution functions; Electric power plant loads; Highway bridges; Iterative methods; Traffic surveys; Applied loads; Axle weights; Distribution factor; Influence lines; Multiple presence; Response functions; Road bridge; Signal separation; Traffic loading; Transverse load distributions; Vehicles,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 52008162; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation: 2020M680114; Guangxi Key Research and Development Program: 2019SK2172; Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province: 2020RC2018","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52008162), the Key Research and Development Program of Hunan Province (Grant No. 2019SK2172), the Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province (Grant No. 2020RC2018), and the Fellowship of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2020M680114).",,"(2012) Bridge Design Specifications, , AASHTO. 8th ed.

Whenever excess energy is generated, it can be stored in large-scale battery systems to support the grid during peak loads, nullifying the need for gas/diesel power plants. Battery storage is remodelling the global electric grid and is a key element for the shift to sustainable energy. In order to extract optimum performance and to ensure reliable, safe working of battery system, its constant monitoring is a must. Digital twin architecture of the battery system offers digital services to different stakeholders starting from the manufacturing through its secondary usage until the end of its life. Digital twin helps in bridging the gap and offers an innovative approach for both manufacturing and usage of the product. This paper focuses on reviewing different architecture of digital twins along with communication protocols, thus providing readers with an insight into recent trends in digital twin architecture for the battery system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Artificial neural network and machine learning; Battery architecture; Battery parameters; Digital twin; Lithium ion battery,Architecture; Computer architecture; Digital twin; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Large scale systems; Manufacture; Network architecture; Power plants; Battery systems; Digital services; Electric grids; Innovative approaches; Optimum performance; Recent trends; Renewable energies; Sustainable energy; Secondary batteries,,,,,,,,"Guide To Understanding Battery Specifications, A., Accessed on Nov 24 (2020).

The load balancing algorithm of the digital twin server cluster significantly impacts the computing performance of the computing nodes. Optimal complete matching of a weighted bipartite graph is proposed to allocate computing task blocks to each computing node evenly. In the proposed algorithm, the computation times of simulation computing task blocks are estimated and the computation time of one single step in the task blocks are used as dynamic load indicators of the computing nodes. The indices are fed back to the scheduling server in real time. With the total steps of the simulation computing task blocks and the computation time of each single step for the task blocks, a fully weighted bipartite graph of computing nodes and simulation computing task blocks is constructed, greedy expansion of the Hungarian algorithm is used to optimize the complete matching of this weighted bipartite graph. Based on the optimization results, the task blocks are allocated to the computing nodes correspondingly in real time. Simulation-driven model parameter correction function, the representative simulation computing applications of digital twin for multi-energy system was used to test the proposed algorithm and the results show a significant improvement of the load balancing effect at the computing nodes. © 2021 The Authors",Digital twin; Load balancing; Simulation computing task blocks; Weighted bipartite graph,Cluster computing; Clustering algorithms; Dynamic loads; Renewable energy resources; Computation time; Computing nodes; Computing-task; Load-Balancing; Matchings; Multi-energy systems; Power; Simulation computing; Simulation computing task block; Single-step; Graph theory,,,,,"China Southern Power Grid, CSG",The above work is partly supported by the key technological project (No. 067600KK52190010 ) of China Southern Power Grid .,,"Teng, Y., Liu, S., Hui, Q., Chen, Z., Integrated demand side response model considering collaborative optimization of regional multi-energy system clusters (2020) Proc CSEE, 40 (22), pp. 7282-7294; Deng, X., Jiang, Z., Sundaresh, L., Yao, W., Yu, W., Wang, W., A time-domain electromechanical co-simulation framework for power system transient analysis with retainment of user defined models (2020) Int J Electr Power Energy Syst; Deng, X., Bian, D., Wang, W., Jiang, Z., Yao, W., Qiu, W., Deep learning model to detect various synchrophasor data anomalies (2020) IET Gener Transm Dist; Deng, X., Bian, D., Shi, D., Yao, W., Wu, L., Liu, Y., Impact of low data quality on disturbance triangulation application using high-density PMU measurements (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 105054-105061; Shen, C., Jia, M., Chen, Y., Huang, S., Xiang, Y., Digital twin of the energy internet and its application (2020) J Glob Energy Interconnect, 3 (1), pp. 1-13; Shao, C., Wang, X., Wang, X., Probe into analysis and planning of multi-energy systems (2016) Proc CSEE, 36 (14); Li, J., Nie, Y., , pp. 2387-2391. , Zhou, A dynamic load balancing algorithm based on consistent hash.

However, there is a lack of an overall framework to study the top-level planning of Industrial Internet Platform (IIP) from a systematic perspective. On the other hand, there are few studies on the detailed path and steps for implementing IIP in a specific enterprise in a specific industry. The objective of this paper is to study a reference framework and industrial implementation path for IIP in product service system using industrial practice investigation method, which meets the needs of industry on the basis of existing theory and industrial practice, and to provide reference for government and industry planning, design, implementation and promotion of IIP.
