Method: For this research paper, primary data was collected with the help of sur-veying different retail companies that are operational in Jordan with a sample of 400 participants. The survey questionnaire was based on a Likert scale where five points ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree were provided to the par-ticipants. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) used to analyse the impact and significance of the different factors on the adoption of AI and ML in Jordanian retail sector. Results: It has been concluded from this research paper that communication, gov-ernment regulations, market structure, and technological infrastructure are impor-tant factors that influence the adoption of AI and ML in the retail industry of Jordan. However, the results of this research have pointed out that managerial support and vendor relationship do not have a significant influence on the adoption of AI and ML. Limitations: The scope of the research is restricted to the context of the retail industry only. This research has been carried out in the context of Jordan thus it cannot be applied on to other geographical backgrounds. Due to the time and scope limitations, there are restricted factors considered in the framework. © 2020, Brno University of Technology.

Recent developments in artificial intelligence and e-commerce enable market participation by software agents that are (almost) perfectly rational due to their computational capacity. However, the increasing degree of buyers’ rationality might have unfavorable effects on retail markets with regards to the competition between sellers and the resulting prices. In this paper, we study the effects of varying degrees of buyers’ rationality on the competition and the prices buyers face in retail markets with identical items. We use the multinomial logit function to model different degrees of buyers’ rationality. We further model the competition between sellers using k-level reasoning: each seller computes the price to offer (best response strategy) with regards to its belief for the competition. First, we derive an analytical best response strategy (price) of a seller given the competing prices and the degree of buyers’ rationality, and show that there exists an optimal degree of buyers’ rationality that minimizes the price. Last, we use evolutionary game theory to show that perfect rationality leads to unstable competition dynamics increasing the overall cost for buyers. In contrast, bounded rationality leads to smoother dynamics and lower cost for buyers. Our insights raise the need to revisit design objectives for software agents in retail markets in light of their wider systematic impact. © 2019, The Author(s).","Bertrand competition; Bounded rationality; Evolutionary game theory; Hierarchical reasoning",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO

Security experts have predicted that the development of 5G technology will increase the frequency and the vector of DDoS attacks. Moreover, enhanced DDoS attack technology utilises artificial intelligence [1], which will escalate the level of difficulty to identify malicious traffic correctly to mitigate the attack effectively. The Internet service provider (ISP) is the connector between the users and the Internet. Deploying DDoS mitigation systems within the ISP domain can offer an efficient solution. Therefore, we propose a dynamic learning system (DLS) for the ISP. The DLS is an unsupervised ensemble model using the Complete Autoencoder (CA) as base learners to classify network traffic. The utmost difference between the CA and the regular Autoencoder is that the CA exploits the imbalanced characteristic of the attack data to generate a binary classification via a class switch. When the predicted number of normal IP addresses is over 50% of the total IP addresses, the CA swaps the class of the IP addresses. The CA is directed by a reference object (RO), which is either a reference limit or the mean of a reference error function (RL1¯), to furnish the automation to the DLS. The DLS was trained with a TCP-ICMP flood attack and tested with a UDP-TCP and a UDP-TCP-ICMP flood attack data set. The average Recall, Precision and F1 Score are all above 0.97. Additionally, the DLS outperformed the K-means and the Self-Organising Map models on a UDP flood attack data set. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","AI; Autoencoder; Complete autoencoder; Cyber security; DDoS mitigation; Deep learning; Ensemble machine learning; Machine learning; Network security; Unsupervised learning","Denial-of-service attack; Dynamic light scattering; Floods; Health risks; Internet service providers; Learning systems; Network security; Self organizing maps; Service industry; Transmission control protocol; Web services; Binary classification; Ddos mitigations; Ensemble modeling; Internet service providers (ISP); Internet services; Level of difficulties; Malicious traffic; Reference objects; 5G mobile communication systems",,,,,"Irish Research Council: EBPPG/2016/326","This research is funded by the Irish Research Council (Award ID EBPPG/2016/326 ).","https://www.networkworld.com/article/3289108/the-rise-of-artificial-intelligence-ddos-attacks.html, Conran M.

AI-Powered Automated Retail Stores are the next revolution in physical retail. Consumers are facing fully automated technology in these retail stores. Therefore, it is necessary to scrutinize the antecedents of consumers' intention to shop at AI-Powered Automated Retail Stores. This study delves into this area to find the predictors of consumers’ intention to shop at AI-Powered Automated Retail Stores. It extends the technology readiness and acceptance model by the addition of AI context-specific constructs such as Perceived Enjoyment, Customization and Interactivity from the present literature. The proposed model is tested by surveying 1250 consumers & the data is analyzed using the PLS-SEM technique and empirically validated. The outcome of the study reveals that Innovativeness and Optimism of consumers affect the perceived ease and perceived usefulness. Insecurity negatively affects the perceived usefulness of AI-powered automated retail stores. Perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, customization and interactivity are significant predictors of shopping intention of consumers in AI-powered automated stores. This research presents insightful academic and managerial implications in the domain of retailing and technology in retail. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence-powered automated retail stores; Customization; Interactivity; Perceived enjoyment; PLS-SEM; TRAM","artificial intelligence; automation; consumption behavior; empirical analysis; retailing; shopping activity",,,,,,,"Abdallah, A., Dwivedi, Y.K., Rana, N.P., Factors influencing adoption of mobile banking by Jordanian bank customers: extending UTAUT2 with trust (2017) Int.

Meanwhile, omni-channel related operations impose a challenge on either well-established firms or new setups that they have to make “right” decisions to fit in the new retail environment. This review paper endeavors to reveal the established knowledge behind the omni-channel retailing literature, generate managerial implications for firms, and provides a guideline for future research. We conduct this systematic review by adopting citation network analysis (CNA). The CNA helps identify seven independent and interdependent research domains, which depict (or constitute) a whole picture of “omnichannel management”. The main path analysis reveals that each identified research domain is under study. We also find that the extant literature seldom examines the roles of how new technologies play in the “omnichannel management”. Moreover, the domain of supply chain management and inventory management in the omnichannel environment is absent in this systematic literature review. Therefore, we propose a prescribed framework for “omnichannel management” (PFOM), which contributes to the literature on “omnichannel management” and provides important managerial applications to the retail firms that plan to implement the omnichannel strategy. © 2020","Omni-channel management; Omni-channel retailing; Omni-channel strategy; Review","Augmented reality; Inventory control; Managers; Metadata; Regression analysis; Reviews; Supply chain management; Channel management; Channel strategies; Emerging technologies; Inventory management; Main path analysis; Managerial implications; Omni-channel retailing; Systematic literature review; Sales",,,,,,,"Abdulkader, M.M.S., Gajpal, Y., ElMekkawy, T.Y., Vehicle routing problem in omni-channel retailing distribution systems (2018) Int.

This research investigates differences between consumers' evaluations of a GAN-generated product and a non-GAN-generated product and tests whether disclosing the use of GAN technology affects consumers' evaluations. Design/methodology/approach: Sample products were developed as experimental stimuli using cycleGAN. Data were collected from 163 members of Generation Y. Participants were assigned to one of the three experimental conditions (i.e. non-GAN-generated images, GAN-generated images with disclosure and GAN-generated images without disclosure). Regression analysis and ANOVA were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Functional, social and epistemic consumption values positively affect willingness to pay in the GAN-generated products. Relative to non-GAN-generated products, willingness to pay is significantly higher for GAN-generated products. Moreover, evaluations of functional value, emotional value and willingness to pay are highest when GAN technology is used, but not disclosed. Originality/value: This study evaluates the utility of GANs from consumers' perspective based on the perceived value of GAN-generated product designs. Findings have practical implications for firms that are considering using GANs to develop products for the retail fashion market. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AI aversion; Artificial intelligence (AI); Consumption value theory; Fashion consumer behaviour; Generative adversarial networks (GANs)",,,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE

In this context, artificial intelligence models such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) have been established and inferences from the datasets have been made. During the establishment of the models, datasets have been prepared with and without color details of the products, for nine different products as separately and one combined dataset which consists all products, then the forecast process was carried out. Thus 20 different models were established and compared. Along with color detail, other variables that may have an effect on the sales performance such as weather, gender, special days etc., have been added to proposed models. In the comparison of methods root mean square error has been taken into consideration. As a result of this study, it has been determined that ANN outperformed SVM on seven datasets out of ten for the datasets without color and their performances were even for the datasets with color. The reliability of this study has been increased by comparing the results of the methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Apparel; Artificial neural networks; Retail demand forecasting; Support vector machines; Textile","Clothes; Color; Forecasting; Garment industry; Mean square error; Neural networks; Sales; Apparel industry; Color parameter; Comparison of methods; Demand forecasting; Product variety; Root mean square errors; Sales forecasting; Sales performance; Support vector machines",,,,,,,"Abolghasemi, M., Beh, E., Tarr, G., Gerlach, R., Demand forecasting in supply chain: The impact of demand volatility in the presence of promotion (2020) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 142, p. 106380; Anastasiadis, A.D., Magoulas, G.D., Vrahatis, M.N., New globally convergent training scheme based on the resilient propagation algorithm (2005) Neurocomputing, 64, pp. 253-270; Candelieri, A., Giordani, I., Archetti, F., Barkalov, K., Meyerov, I., Polovinkin, A., Zolotykh, N., Tuning hyperparameters of a SVM-based water demand forecasting system through parallel global optimization (2019) Computers & Operations Research, 106, pp. 202-209; Chalisgaonkar, R., Kumar, J., Pant, P., Prediction of machining characteristics of finish cut WEDM process for pure titanium using feed forward back propagation neural network (2019) Materials Today: Proceedings; Chen, Y., Mining of instant messaging data in the Internet of Things based on support vector machine (2020) Computer Communications, 154, pp. 278-287; Cooper, S.J., Donald O.

A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from customers in supermarkets. Descriptive statistics and correlations were used to analyse the collected data sets to attain a statistically supported conclusion. The research found customer feedback service channels impacted on customers' satisfaction. Customers were not satisfied with the rate of responsiveness to their feedback. The study designed and proposed a customer feedback service channel with AI as an alternative to existing feedback channels. It concluded that an AI designed system should be developed and implemented in supermarkets to test the intended outcome of the feedback channels and to design a robust system as a goods locator map and internal survey model. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Co.","artificial intelligence;

The aim of this study is to provide an overview of existing systematic reviews in this growing area of research and to synthesise the findings related to drivers, barriers and social implications of the AI adoption in business and management. The methodology used for this tertiary study is based on Kitchenham and Charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. These reviews cover the AI adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (HR, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). While the drivers for the AI adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders'perspectives. Very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the AI adoption. In addition to increased focus on social implications of AI, the reviews are recommending more rigorous evaluation, increased use of hybrid solutions (AI and non-AI) and multidisciplinary approach to AI design and evaluation. Furthermore, this study found that there is a lack of systematic reviews in some of the early AI adoption sectors such as financial industry and retail. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Business; Machine learning; Management; Systematic literature review; Tertiary study","Accident prevention; Agricultural robots; Decision support systems; Health care; Job satisfaction; Leisure industry; Project management; Reusability; Service industry; Social aspects; Supply chains; Tourism; Business and management; Design and evaluations; Health-care managements; Multi-disciplinary approach; Multiple stakeholders; Rigorous evaluation; Systematic literature review; Technology adoption; Information management; artificial intelligence; business development; literature review; machine learning; management; social impact; technology adoption",,,,,,,"Arksey, H., O'Malley, L., Scoping studies: towards a methodological framework (2005) Int.

However, there is a lack of effort on the development of new techniques for solving that problem and, therefore, achieving higher performance, which is important for the efficient management of energy in many levels. This study addresses this gap by proposing a new hybrid machine learning algorithm that incorporates the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model with a new version of the firefly algorithm denominated as the gender-difference firefly algorithm. We expanded the search space diversification to increase the accuracy on the prediction and adopted the autoregressive process in order to approximate the chaotic behavior of the consumption time series. A new layer, denominated as non-working time adaptation was also integrated so as to decrease the fast variability of the predictions during non-working periods of time. We have applied our algorithm for the consumption prediction on 1 h, 2 h and 3 h ahead horizons. We have obtained improvements on the MAPE and R coefficient when compared with state-of-the-art publications in both a private dataset from the Faculty of Chemistry, located in the city of Murcia, Spain and a public dataset of the consumption of a Retail building located in California, United States. We also show our method's performance in five more buildings. Our results demonstrate the robustness and the accuracy of our proposal when compared to the traditional adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system models and also to the different predictive techniques implemented in several pieces of literature. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ANFIS; Autoregressive process; Building energy consumption; Gender-difference firefly algorithm; Time series forecasting","Bioluminescence; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Inference engines; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Optimization; Time series; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Artificial intelligence techniques; Auto regressive process; Energy consumption prediction; Hybrid machine learning; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Search space diversification; Time series forecasting; Fuzzy inference; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial intelligence; energy use; forecasting method; fuzzy mathematics; performance assessment; prediction; time series analysis; California; Murcia [Spain]; Spain; United States",,,,,"European Social Fund, ESF

This suggests that understanding how mobile consumers use smartphones for fashion shopping is important in developing digital shopping platforms that fulfil consumer' expectations. Design/methodology/approach: For this research, mobile eye-tracking technology was employed in order to develop unique shopping journeys for 30 consumers, using fashion retailers' websites on smartphones, documenting their differences and similarities in browsing and purchasing behaviour. Findings: Based on scan path visualisations and observed shopping experiences, three prominent mobile shopping journeys and shopper types were identified: “directed by retailer's website”, “efficient self-selected journey” and “challenging shopper”. These prominent behaviour patterns were used to characterise mixed cluster behaviours; three distinct mixed clusters were identified, namely, “extended self-selected journey”, “challenging shoppers directed by retailer's website” and “focused challenging shopper”. Research limitations/implications: This research argues that mobile consumers can be segmented based on their activities and behaviours on the mobile website. Knowing the prominent shopping behaviour types any other complex behaviour patterns can be identified, analysed and described. Practical implications: The findings of this research can be used in developing personalised shopping experiences on smartphones by feeding these shopper types into retailers' digital marketing strategy and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Originality/value: This paper contributes to consumer behaviour literature by proposing a novel mobile consumer segmentation approach based on detailed shopping journey analysis using mobile eye-tracking technology. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Consumer segmentation; Customer journey; Eye tracking; Fashion consumer behaviour; Fashion retailing; Mobile consumer; Shopping journey",,,,,,,,"Anderl, E., Becker, I., von Wangenheim, F., Schumann, J.H., Mapping the customer journey: lessons learned from graph-based online attribution modelling (2016) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 33 (3), pp. 457-474; Barwitz, N., Maas, P., Understanding the omnichannel customer journey: determinants of interaction choice (2018) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 43, pp. 116-133; Bellman, S., Potter, R.F., Treleaven-Hassard, S., Robinson, J.A., Varan, D., The effectiveness of branded mobile phone apps (2011) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 25 (4), pp. 191-200; Benn, Y., Webb, T., Chang, B.P.I., Reidy, J., What information do consumers consider, and how do they look for it, when shopping for groceries online?

Usually, an evolving system contains evolving interconnected entities (or components) that make evolving networks for the system State Series SS = {S1, S2 ⋯ SN created over time, where Si represents the ith system state. In this paper, we introduce an approach for mining Network Evolution Subgraphs such as Network Evolution Graphlets (NEGs) and Network Evolution Motifs (NEMs) from a set of evolving networks. We used graphlets information of a state to calculate System State Complexity (SSC). The System State Complexities (SSCs) represent time-varying complexities of multiple states. Additionally, we also used the NEGs information to calculate Evolving System Complexity (ESC) for a state series over time. We proposed an algorithm named System Network Complexity (SNC) for mining NEGs, SSCs, and ESC, which analyzes a pre-evolved state series of an evolving system. We prototyped the technique as a tool named SNC-Tool, which is applied to six real-world evolving systems collected from open-internet repositories of four different domains: software system, natural language system, retail market basket system, and IMDb movie genres system. This is demonstrated as experimentation reports containing retrieved - NEGs, NEMs, SSCs, and ESC - for each evolving system. © 2017 IEEE.","complexity theory; Data mining; network theory (graphs); systems engineering and theory","Aggregates; Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Data mining; Measurement; NEMS; Silicon; Tools; Complexity theory; Computation intelligences; Different domains; Evolving networks; Natural language systems; Network complexity; Network evolution; Systems engineering and theories; Network theory (graphs)",,,,,,,"Ross, A.M., Rhodes, D.H., Hastings, D.E., Defining changeability: Reconciling flexibility, adaptability, scalability, modifiability, and robustness for maintaining system lifecycle value (2008) Syst.

Previous studies have just focused on the perspective of big data utilization in Industry 4.0 and neglected the role of business intelligence systems (BIS), especially in the T&A industry. The current study is one of the first to investigate the determinants of BIS adoption with an eye towards understanding how BIS can resolve sustainability issues in T&A companies with Industry 4.0 technologies. Methodology: A qualitative research approach is applied with 14 semi-structured in-depth interviews from 12 of the world's high-end T&A companies. The snowball and purposeful sampling strategy is used to select the participants. The qualitative content analysis technique is used to analyze the interview data. Results: The findings revealed various themes, such as sustainability issues in T&A companies, improved value creation processes with leading BI solutions, and perceived difficulties in the adoption of BIS. Major improvements are perceived in the apparel retail business because apparel companies are more prone to adopt the Industry 4.0 technologies with advanced business intelligence (BI) solutions. The results prove the pivotal role of economic sustainability in the adoption of BIS and Industry 4.0 technologies in T&A companies. © 2020 by the authors.","Apparel industry; Business intelligence systems adoption; Industry 4.0; Sustainability; Textile industry","advanced technology; artificial intelligence; business development; industrial regulation; industrial technology; sustainability; textile industry",,,,,,,"Balogun, A.-L., Tyler, D., Han, S., Moora, H., Paco, A., Boiten, V.J., Ellams, D., Leal Filho, W., A review of the socio-economic advantages of textile recycling (2019) J.

On the other hand, in order to obtain high reward, retail traders may form alliance, where a cheating retail trader accumulates the deals of other retail traders. This type of commercial fraud is called deal cheating or cross region sale. Because the sales contain a lot of normal big deals, traditional outlier detection methods cannot distinguish the normal extreme value and the true outlier generated by deal cheating behavior. Meanwhile, the sparsity of the multidimensional sales data makes the outlier detection methods based on multidimensional space cannot work effectively. To handle the aforementioned problems, this study proposes deal cheating mining algorithms based on ratio characteristic and tensor reconstruction method. These algorithms combine artificial intelligence and database technique. Meanwhile, because there are multiple types of deal cheating patterns, this study proposes deal cheating pattern classification methods based on the partially ordered lattice of deal cheating patterns. In the experiments on synthetic data, the deal cheating detection algorithm based on the ratio characteristic can achieve an average AUC-value of 65%. The traditional feature extraction methods can only achieve average AUC-values of 36% and 30%. In the experiments on the real data, the results shows the deal cheating detection algorithm is capable of distinguishing normal big deal from abnormal big deal which may be generated by the deal cheating behaviors. © Copyright 2020, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Robo-advisors are in use in the developed nations since over a decade but have recently entered the developing nations, like India, since early 2015. This research explores the present state of Robo-advisory services in the Indian context and investigates how Robo-advisors can help in mitigating behavioral biases of a retail investor. The present study gives an in-depth understanding about the ability of Robo-advisory to mitigate behavioral biases from the perspective of experts. These experts are from the product development team, quality control team, middleware, or at top management level from BFSI (Banking and Financial Services Industry), IT (Information Technology), FINTECH (Finance Technology) and NBFCs (Non-Banking Finance Companies) in India. The researchers have adopted a qualitative approach, of interviewing these experts, to discover the phenomenon and gain insight about Robo-advisory services. Each interview was recorded and transcribed on word-for-word basis. The transcribed content underwent a structured content analysis, using different categories, resulting from the conducted literature review. The intent is not to generalize the findings, since the field of Robo-advisory is at a nascent stage as far as Indian market is concerned. The key findings indicate that the current focus is to increase awareness level amongst investors, by educating them and by building trust. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that Robo-advisors still need to mitigate investor's biases while performing risk analysis and profiling the investors. Robo-advisory platforms are not yet comprehensively self-sufficient to accurately perform risk analysis for retail investors. © 2020","Artificial Intelligence; Behavioral biases; Behavioral finance; Fintech; Robo advisors",,,,,,,,"Abraham, F., Schmukler, S.L., Tessada, J., Robo-Advisors: Investing Through Machines: World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, (134881) (2019); Insights into the users of robo-advisory firms (2018) J.

Virtual assistants already take care of grocery shopping by replenishing used up ingredients while cooking machines prepare these ingredients and implement recipes. In the future, consumers will be able to delegate substantial parts of the shopping process to autonomous shopping systems. Whereas the functional benefits of these systems are evident, they challenge psychological consumption motives and ingrained human–machine relationships due to the delegation of decisions and tasks to technology. The authors take a cross-disciplinary approach drawing from research in marketing, psychology, and human–computer interaction to examine barriers to adoption of autonomous shopping systems. They identify different types of psychological and cultural barriers, and suggest ways to craft the online and bricks-and-mortar retail environment to overcome these barriers along the consumer journey.

As of now, GAFA‘s storming into financial services is incidental to and an extension of their normal business. With their ability to map, analyze and leverage big data across social media, smart phones, customer purchase information, and expectations of retail banking services, GAFA can provide a high quality personalized customer experience. To cope with these challenges, banks must transform themselves to offer a richer and satisfying customer experience. The digital as well as physical environments need to be integrated. Advanced information and communication technologies such as artificial intelligence can provide better insights into individual customer preferences. But there is a need for quick action. Amazon, Apple, Google, Intuit and PayPal have already joined hands in an association called 'Financial Innovation Now‘, to encourage innovation in financial services. Global encouragement to 'FinTech‘ has paved the way for other digital disruptors. Banks must face these challenges and be proactive. They need to review and revise their business models and develop new revenue streams. This is precisely where advanced technologies can help. This paper asserts that to face such intensely technological competition, the banking industry will have to develop the ability to systematically and strategically leverage customer insights, advanced analytics and digital technologies. © IJSTR 2020.","Banking; CRM; Customer; Digital; GAFA; PSD2; Technology",,,,,,,,"Yu, H., Xie, W., Yang, L., Du, A., Almeida, C.M., Wang, Y., From payments for ecosystem services to eco-compensation: Conceptual change or paradigm shift?

In terms of these shops, the design of vending machine is critical to user shopping experience. The conventional design typically uses weighing sensors incapable of sensing what the customer is taking. In the present study, a smart unstaffed retail shop scheme is proposed based on artificial intelligence and the internet of things, as an attempt to enhance the user shopping experience remarkably. To analyze multiple target features of commodities, the SSD ( $300\times 300$ ) algorithm is employed; the recognition accuracy is further enhanced by adding sub-prediction structure. Using the data set of 18, 000 images in different practical scenarios containing 20 different type of stock keeping units, the comparison experimental results reveal that the proposed SSD ( $300\times 300$ ) model outperforms than the original SSD ( $300\times 300$ ) in goods detection, the mean average precision of the developed method reaches 96.1% on the test dataset, revealing that the system can make up for the deficiency of conventional unmanned container. The practical test shows that the system can meet the requirements of new retail, which greatly increases the customer flow and transaction volume. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; Internet of Things; SSD; Unstaffed retail; vending machine","Internet of things; Machine shops; Sales; Statistical tests; User experience; Conventional design; Data set; Multiple targets; Practical tests; Prediction structures; Recognition accuracy; Stock keeping unit; Artificial intelligence",,,,,"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation: 2020M670993

However, the number of returns made on online purchases is also increasing and have a profound impact on retailers’ operations and profit. Hence, retailers need to balance between minimizing and allowing product returns. This study examines an offline showroom versus an artificial intelligence (AI) online virtual-reality webroom and how the settings affect customers’ purchase and retailers’ return decisions. A case study is used to illustrate the AI application. Our results show that adopting artificial intelligence helps sellers to make better returns policies, maximize reselling returns, and reduce the risks of leftovers and shortages. Our findings unlock the potential of artificial intelligence applications in retail operations and should interest practitioners and researchers in online retailing, especially those concerned with online returns policies and the consumer personalized service experience. © 2020, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Exchange; Fit; Offline showroom; Returns policies",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71872158, 71871197, 71571151","The authors thank the editors and two referees for their helpful suggestions and comments during the review process.

This paper aims to explore these characteristics to develop a typology of art consumers using a mixed method approach over several studies. Design/methodology/approach: This is achieved by analyzing qualitative data, gathered via semi-structured interviews of art collectors, and quantitatively by means of natural language processing analysis and automated text analysis and using correspondence analysis to analyze and present the results. Findings: The study’s findings reveal four distinct clusters of art collectors based on their “Big Five” personality traits, as well as uncovering insights into how these types talk about their possessions. Research limitations/implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of consumers that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions in other markets. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating the “doubling” procedure to deal with percentile data. Practical implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of art collectors that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating a non-traditional application of correspondence analysis using the “doubling” procedure. Buyer behavior in the fine art market is not exhaustively studied. By understanding the personality traits of consumers in the art market, sales forces can better provide assistance and product to consumers. Further, understanding the personalities of consumers is better for art retail spaces to better serve consumers. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates a unique mixed methods approach to analyzing unstructured qualitative data. It shows how text data can be used to identify measurable market segments for which targeted strategies can be developed. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Art collectors; Artificial intelligence; Automated text analysis; Correspondence analysis; Psychographic consumer segmentation; Psychographic segmentation; Quantitative analysis of qualitative data",,,,,,,,"Amabile, T.M., Phillips, E.D., Collins, M.A., Creativity by contract: social influences on the creativity of professional fine artists (1993) Annual Meeting of the American Psychological Association, , Toronto, Ontario; Arnould, E.J., Price, L., Moisio, R., Making contexts matter: Selecting research contexts for theoretical insights (2006) Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Marketing, pp. 106-125. , Belk, R.

AI technologies are widely used to support different activities in retail operations. In particular, retail firms have adopted chatbots to interact with consumers through various communication channels, including social media, live chat, SMS etc. In addition, chatbots have been used to support conversational commerce in which companies automate conversations with consumers about product selection and assist consumers to make informed choices throughout the shopping and decision-making processes. To investigate the state of the art of chatbots in the retail industry, this article qualitatively studies commercial chatbots from 40 retail firms. The study finds that chatbots assist consumers in completing general tasks, such as searching information, purchasing products, making reservations and collecting feedback. Chatbots are good enough to perform such general tasks, although they have limited capability with respect to processing and interpreting natural language. Chatbots also provide menus to address the most predominant issues encountered by consumers while running at a lower operational cost. It is anticipated that chatbots will gain popularity in the retail industry, and consumers would benefit from chatbots with improved features like more accurate predictions and better product recommendations. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Chatbot; Conversational commerce; Retailing",,,,,,,,"Rinberg, A., Tobin, S., (2019) Amazon’s one-two punch: how traditional retailers can fight back, , https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/amazons-one-two-punch-how-traditional-retailers-can-fight-back/, (accessed 9th November, 2019); Tillman, M., (2019) What is Amazon Go, where is it, and how does it work, , https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/amazon/139650-what-is-amazon-go-where-is-it-and-how-does-it-work, (accessed 9th November, 2019); Baird, N., (2017) To compete with Amazon, retailers reach for AI: here’s how some get it wrong, , https://www.forbes.com/sites/nikkibaird/2017/10/31/retails-big-questions-to-ask-about-artificial-intelligence/#4594c2b86da2, (accessed 9th November, 2019); Shankar, V., How artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping retailing (2018) Journal of Retailing, 94 (4), pp. vi-xi; Ellet, L.K., (2018) Growth among consumer goods companies continues to slow, , https://home.kpmg.com/uk/en/home/media/press-releases/2018/06/growth-among-consumer-goods-companies-continues-to-slow.html, (accessed 9th November, 2019); Baird, ref. 3 above; Waters, R., (2019) Everything still to play for with AI in its infancy, , https://www.ft.com/content/bf3d708c-3077-11e9-8744-e7016697f225, (accessed 9th November, 2019); Weber, F., Schütte, R., State-of-the-art and adoption of artificial intelligence in retailing (2019) Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance, 21 (3), pp. 264-279; Seranmadevi, R., Kumar, A.S., Experiencing the AI emergence in Indian retail — early adopters approach (2018) Management Science Letters, 9 (1), pp. 33-42; Weber, F., Schütte, R., A domain-oriented analysis of the impact of machine learning — the case of retailing (2019) Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 3 (1), pp. 11-24; Daigler, J., Shen, S., (2017) Create new opportunities by exploiting thing commerce data, , https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3750263/create-new-opportunities-by-exploiting-thing-commerce-da, (accessed 9th November, 2019); (2017) AI Today, AI Tomorrow ARM with Northstar Research Partners, , http://pages.arm.com/rs/312-SAX-488/images/arm-ai-survey-report.pdf, ARM and Northstar (accessed 9th November, 2019); (2017) How AI is pushing man and machine closer together, , https://www.pwc.in/assets/pdfs/consulting/digital-enablement-advisory1/pwc-botme-booklet.pdf, PricewaterhouseCoopers (accessed 9th November, 2019); An, M., Artificial intelligence is here — people just don’t realize it (2017) Hubspot Research, , https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/assets/hubspot.com/research/reports/AIIsHere_HubSpot.pdf, (accessed 9th November, 2019); Martin, C., (2017) 16% of retailers using AI, 20% plan to add in next year, , https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/308406/16-of-retailers-using-ai-20-plan-to-add-in-next.html, (accessed 9th November, 2019); Rekha, A, Abdulla, M., Asharaf, S., Artificial intelligence marketing: an application of a novel lightly trained support vector data description (2016) Journal of Information and Optimization Sciences, 37 (5), pp. 681-691; Busignani, L., (2017) Changing of the guard: Is traditional trade planning obsolete?, , https://consumergoods.com/changing-guard-traditional-trade-planning-obsolete, (accessed 9th November, 2019); Cecere, L., Tech trends 2017: Redefining trade promotion (2017) Consumer Goods Technology, , https://consumergoods.com/tech-trends-2017-redefining-trade-promotion, (accessed 9th November, 2019); Martinez-Lopez, F.J., Casillas, J., Artificial intelligence-based systems applied in industrial marketing: An historical overview, current and future insights (2013) Industrial Marketing Management, 42 (4), pp. 489-495; Wirth, N., Hello marketing, what can artificial intelligence help you with?

This paper presents a new intelligent system that uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a high-resolution camera to identify the theft behavior of customers. The CNN extracts relevant information from the theft and non-theft behavior of customers in supermarkets to establish a recognition model. Our results show that, by updating the data sets, the recognition model can be continuously optimized, and the average recognition accuracy finally reaches 83 %. The proposed system can independently identify the theft and non-theft behavior in video surveillance and sound alarm on the theft behavior in time. The advantages of the system are its low cost and high precision, which show excellent commercial value and application prospects. © CTU FTS 2020","Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural network; Information extraction; Sound alarm","Convolutional neural networks; Costs; Intelligent systems; Retail stores; Security systems; Application prospect; High resolution camera; High-precision; Intelligent security; Low costs; Recognition accuracy; Recognition models; Video surveillance; Crime",,,,,"2019DE0KF01

This study aims to explore a public–private partnership (PPP) that leverages advanced digital technologies via spinoffs to tackle the key challenge of showrooming that retail shops are facing. Showrooming is the phenomenon in which shoppers go to the physical stores to gather in-depth product information, and later on, decide to buy the product from online retail competitors. Design/methodology/approach: This research draws on a longitudinal qualitative study of a social context in which digital entrepreneurs are embedded. The empirical setting is a retail network in Italy, Germany and Finland with a particular focus on the process in which a PPP delivers innovation via spinoffs in the context of brick and mortar shops (B&M). The research design enables an understanding of the complexity of the phenomenon from a business and a social perspective. Findings: New technology to tackle showrooming enables the creation of substantial hybrid value in retail partnerships. Spinoffs are key actors in leveraging digital technologies to create value faster and more tailored compared with large software companies. Spinoff entrepreneurs leverage on specific technologies (e.g. virtual reality and artificial intelligence) available inside organizations’ network (i.e. PPPs). Spinoffs are found to be a fundamental actor in the process of dealing with showrooming because of their time to market. Large software companies usually are not interested in approaching B&M shops because of the high operational costs of product customization for B&M shops. Practical implications: Managers could use the success factors of the spinoffs in helping their B&M shops to improve both shopper experience and salesperson performance. For managers of B2B retail network, the results are useful towards increasing the involvement of shoppers while they are visiting physical stores, and it also improves salesperson performance. It also leads to the observation that cross-selling is one of the most effective responses to the phenomenon of showrooming. As practical implications for policymakers, the current research supports the view that PPPs should support the creation of spinoffs as a result of longitudinal innovation projects. Social implications: Retail technologies leveraged from a PPP and commercialized by spinoffs are powerful tools to enable a better quality of salespeople’s life in the working place. At the same time, these new technologies help shop owners increase the retention rates, conversion rates and reduce short-term loss, increasing the likelihood of B&M shops to survive in the condition of extreme competition caused by the showrooming phenomenon. Originality/value: This research proposes a model of hybrid value creation from networks in digital retail. The model indicates that PPPs create spinoffs to explore showrooming and deliver substantial hybrid value (i.e. business and social) for physical retail shops, mainly because it influences the companies’ growth, employee performance and customer satisfaction. This model expands the field of B2B marketing by identifying factors that enable spinoff creation from retail networks and proposes success factors and research propositions in retail networks. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer engagement; Digital entrepreneurship; Hybrid value creation; Public–private partnerships; Showrooming; Spin-off creation",,,,,,,,"Aarikka-Stenroos, L., Jaakkola, E., Harrison, D., Mäkitalo-Keinonen, T., How to manage innovation processes in extensive networks: a longitudinal study (2017) Industrial Marketing Management, 67, pp. 88-105; Agarwal, N., Chakrabarti, R., Brem, A., Bocken, N., Market driving at bottom of the pyramid (BoP): an analysis of social enterprises from the healthcare sector (2018) Journal of Business Research, 86, pp. 234-244; Ahearne, M., Jones, E., Rapp, A., Mathieu, J., High touch through high tech: the impact of salesperson technology usage on sales performance via mediating mechanisms (2008) Management Science, 54 (4), pp. 671-685; Ailawadi, K.L., Farris, P.W., Managing multi-and Omni-channel distribution: metrics and research directions (2017) Journal of Retailing, 93 (1), pp. 120-135; Ammon, T., Brem, A., Von Gutenberg zu Steve Jobs, Herausforderungen und Lösungen der business model innovation dargestellt am beispiel von (Fach-) Verlagen (2014) Kompendium Geschäftsmodell-Innovation, pp. 319-347. , Springer Gabler, Wiesbaden; Apostolov, M., Coco, N., Digitalization based innovation – a case study framework (2020) International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management, , doi:, press; Baddar-Alhussan, F., Fletcher-Chen, C.C.Y., Batt, P.J., Editorial: networks: relationships and innovation (2017) Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 32 (6), pp. 773-775; Baierl, R., Behrens, J., Brem, A., (2019) Digital Entrepreneurship.

CCS are not a typical technological advancement but an unprecedented advance toward human-like systems fueled by artificial intelligence. Such systems can adapt to situations, perceive their environments, and interact with humans and other technologies. Due to these properties, CCS are already disrupting established industries, such as retail, insurance, and healthcare. As we make the case in this paper, the increasingly human-like capabilities of CCS challenge five fundamental assumptions that we as IS researchers have held about how users interact with IT artifacts. These assumptions pertain to (1) the direction of the userartifact relationship, (2) the artifact’s awareness of its environment, (3) functional transparency, (4) reliability, and (5) the user’s awareness of artifact use. We argue that the disruption of these five assumptions limits the applicability of our extant body of knowledge to CCS. Consequently, CCS present a unique opportunity for novel theory development and associated contributions. We argue that IS is well positioned to take this opportunity and present research questions that, if answered, will lead to interesting, influential, and original theories. © 2020 by the Association for Information Systems.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Assumptions; Cognitive Computing Systems (CCS); Expert Systems (ES); Intelligent Agents (IA); Research agenda","Computation theory; Body of knowledge; Cognitive ability; Cognitive computing systems; Computing system; Research questions; Technological advancement; Theory development; User-system interaction; Cognitive systems",,,,,,,"Abbasi, A., Zahedi, F.M., Zeng, D., Chen, Y., Chen, H., Nunamaker, J.F., Enhancing predictive analytics for anti-phishing by exploiting website genre information (2015) Journal of Management Information Systems, 31 (4); Adair, J.G., The Hawthorne effect: A reconsideration of the methodological artifact (1984) Journal of Applied Psychology, 69 (2), pp. 334-345; Adomavicius, G., Gupta, A., Zhdanov, D., Designing intelligent software agents for auctions with limited information feedback (2009) Information Systems Research, 20 (4), pp. 507-526; Agarwal, R., Karahanna, E., Time flies when you're having fun: Cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage (2000) MIS Quarterly, 24 (4), pp. 665-694; Agarwal, R., Sambamurthy, V., Stair, R.M., The Evolving Relationship Between General and Specific Computer Self-Efficacy—An Empirical Assessment (2000) Information Systems Research, 11 (4), pp. 418-430; Ahmed, M.N., Toor, A.S., O'neil, K., Friedland, D., (2017) Cognitive Computing and the Future of Health Care, , https://pulse.embs.org/may-2017/cognitive-computing-and-the-future-of-healthcare/; Aleksander, I., Advances in intelligent information technology: Re-branding or progress towards conscious machines?

However, framing resilient and correct smart contracts (SCs) for these smart application is a quite challenging task because of the complexity associated with them. SC is modernizing the traditional industrial, technical, and business processes. It is self-executable, self-verifiable, and embedded into the BC that eliminates the need for trusted third-party systems, which ultimately saves administration as well as service costs. It also improves system efficiency and reduces the associated security risks. However, SCs are well encouraging the new technological reforms in Industry 4.0, but still, various security and privacy challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, a survey on SC security vulnerabilities in the software code that can be easily hacked by a malicious user or may compromise the entire BC network is presented. As per the literature, the challenges related to SC security and privacy are not explored much by the authors around the world. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that designing a complex SCs cannot mitigate its privacy and security issues. So, this paper investigates various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and tools for SC privacy protection. Then, open issues and challenges for AI-based SC are analyzed. Finally, a case study of retail marketing is presented, which uses AI and SC to preserve its security and privacy. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; blockchain; Cyber-physical system; privacy; security; smart contract","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Complex networks; Cyber Physical System; Data privacy; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Issues and challenges; Privacy and security; security; Security and privacy; Security vulnerabilities; Techniques and tools; Trusted third parties; Embedded systems",,,,,"2018R1D1A1A09082266

However, there needs to be an approach that can integrate human and machine interaction and make it a sustainable implementation. Using framework developed by Mohapatra (2019), we find that such parameters that can improve physical interactions with humans and domain processes. This article is an attempt to characterise these challenges and to exhibit a set of key decisional issues that need to be addressed for a cognitive robot to successfully share space and tasks with a human in retial services in a banking domain (Yang et al. in Inf Syst e-Bus Manag 17(1):1–25, 2019). Here, we identify first the needed individual and collaborative cognitive skills from the published framework and then apply them to a case study in retail banking domain. The article discusses each of these abilities, presents working implementations, and shows how they combine in a coherent and original deliberative architecture for human–robot interaction, which can be used for servicing customers (Tobias and Sebastian in Inf Syst e-Bus Manag 16(3):493–546, 2018). Supported by experimental results, we eventually show how explicit knowledge management, both symbolic and geometric, proves to be instrumental to richer and more natural human–robot interactions by pushing for pervasive, human-level semantics within the robot’s deliberative system. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Banking services; Case study; Framework; Framework validation",,,,,,,,"Abidoye, R.B., Chan, E., Achieving property valuation accuracy in developing countries: the implication of data source (2016) J Hous Markets Anal, 13 (3), pp. 37-72; Beetz, M.S., Lemaignan, R., Ros, L., Mösenlechner, R., Alami, M., ORO, a knowledge management platform for cognitive architectures in robotics (2010) IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems; Ge, X.J., Runeson, G., Modeling property prices using neural network model for Hong Kong (2004) Int Real Estate Rev, 7 (1), pp. 121-138; https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Retail/Our%20Insights/The%20State%20of%20Fashion%202019%20A%20year%20of%20awakening/The-State-of-Fashion-2019-final.ashx; Mora-Esperanza, J.G., Artificial intelligence applied to real estate valuation.

Such changes include the rise of the millennial consumer cohort, and the introduction of retailers implementing enhanced artificial intelligence (AI) data methodology to analyse business, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to enhance experience and co-customization interfaces. Two seminal pieces of literature regarding consumer experience are Ballantine and Parson’s analysis of consumer experience factors and Pine and Gilmore’s (1999) Experience Economy. However, these studies were conducted nearly a decade ago, leaving a void in the literature that does not consider more current factors impacting consumer experience. The purpose of the present research was to: analyse popular press coverage to understand trends in experiential elements; and to extend the Ballantine and Parsons’ framework by proposing more current experiential elements. The researchers used the EBSCO database to generate a list of articles written from 2008 to 2018; these articles were then analysed via a qualitative content analysis method, using Ballantine and Parson’s and Pine and Gilmore’s frameworks as a base. Emergent themes that did not fit the above frameworks were added, thereby updating and extending the current body of knowledge. Findings indicated an increased emphasis on ‘experiential retailing’ over the years 2016–18. Product display, employees, colour and comfort features emerged as the most important Ballantine and Parsons themes, while new emergent themes of technology, uniqueness/personalization and entertainment/escapism/discovery were added to the Ballantine and Parsons framework, thus updating it to reflect current retailing trends. Implications for industry and academia, along with directions for future research are provided. © 2020 Intellect Ltd Article.

For interviews, pretests, and main data collection, we presented video clips of FRAs as stimuli. Based on the data (n = 464) collected via an online survey, we conducted psychological network analysis to explore defining factors that differentiate adoption and nonadoption groups. The results indicate that perceived characteristics of social intelligence, humanlikeness, and knowledgeableness combined with a positive disposition of technological self-efficacy lead to adoption of FRAs. This study contributes to the literature on the theory of HRI and technology acceptance models, particularly in fashion retail sectors. Furthermore, this study provides a new graphical approach to networks that conceptualizes shoppers’ adoption of technology as a complex interplay of psychological attributes. © 2020 ITAA.","artificial intelligence (AI); fashion robot advisor; fashion robotics; human–robot interaction (HRI); network analysis; psychological network analysis; retail robot; robot",,,,,,"University of Tennessee, UT","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors received partial funding for data collection from the Department of Retail and Hospitality Management at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.","Bartneck, C., Croft, E., Kulic, D., (2008) Measuring the anthropomorphism, animacy, likeability, perceived intelligence and perceived safety of robots, , https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10092/16709/bartneckKulicCroftHRI2008.pdf?sequence=2, March, Proceedings of the third ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, (,)., In; Beer, J.M., Prakash, A., Mitzner, T.L., Rogers, W.A., (2011) Understanding robot acceptance, , Human Factors and Aging Laboratory, Georgia Institute of Technology; Bruner, G.C., II, Kumar, A., Gadget lovers (2007) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 35 (3), pp. 329-339; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, , 2nd ed, Lawrence Erlbaum; Compeau, D.R., Higgins, C.A., Computer self-efficacy: Development of a measure and initial test (1995) MIS Quarterly, 19 (2), pp. 189-211; Danaher, P., Wang, P., Witten, D.M., The joint graphical lasso for inverse covariance estimation across multiple classes (2014) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

With AI coming under the spotlight, we know surprisingly little about its impact on consumers’ patronage likelihood. This research attempts to address this void by investigating the “just-walk-out” retail technology in cohort with in-store communication. Across three studies, conducted online and in the field, the authors demonstrate that, compared to self-service checkouts, AI-enabled checkouts lead to significantly higher consumers’ patronage likelihood. Furthermore, sensory stimulation stemming from in-store communication (environmental cues including assortment, advertising, and technology) underlies this impact. Importantly, the extent to which consumers perceive AI technology to be threatening is revealed as a boundary condition to these effects. These findings advance our understanding of how AI-enabled checkouts and in-store communication influence consumers’ patronage likelihood and the boundary condition that moderates their impact. © Copyright © 2020, American Academy of Advertising.",,,,,,,,,"Adams, R., Intelligent advertising (2004) AI & Society, 18 (1), pp. 68-81; Bakpayev, M., Baek, T.H., van Esch, P., Yoon, S., Programmatic creative: AI can think but it cannot feel (2020) Australasian Marketing Journal; Bargh, J.A., Chen, M., Burrows, L., Automaticity of social behavior: Direct effects of trait construct and stereotype activation on action (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71 (2), pp. 230-244; Barone, M.J., Miniard, P.W., How and when factual ad claims mislead consumers: Examining the deceptive consequences of copy × copy interactions for partial comparative advertisements (1999) Journal of Marketing Research, 36 (1), pp. 58-74; Bridgwater, A., (2019) How self-service is changing technology, , https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2019/06/12/how-self-service-is-changing-technology/#35ffb9ce3147, Forbes, June 12; Bues, M., Steiner, M., Stafflage, M., Krafft, M., How mobile in‐store advertising influences purchase intention: Value drivers and mediating effects from a consumer perspective (2017) Psychology & Marketing, 34 (2), pp. 157-174; Burke, R.R., Technology and the customer interface: What consumers want in the physical and virtual store (2002) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 30 (4), pp. 411-432; Burton, S., Garretson, J.A., Velliquette, A.M., Implications of accurate usage of nutrition facts panel information for food product evaluations and purchase intentions (1999) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 27 (4), pp. 470-480; Carreirão, P., (2019) Top 10 self-service technologies that we all love to use!, , https://asksuite.com/blog/top-10-self-service-technologies/, Asksuite, July 31; Chen, G., Xie, P., Dong, J., Wang, T., Understanding programmatic creative: The role of AI (2019) Journal of Advertising, 48 (4), pp. 347-355; Chiu, H.-C., Hsieh, Y.-C., Kuo, Y.-C., How to align your brand stories with your products (2012) Journal of Retailing, 88 (2), pp. 262-275; Chuawatcharin, R., Gerdsri, N., Factors influencing the attitudes and behavioural intentions to use just walk out technology among bangkok consumers (2019) International Journal of Public Sector Performance Management, 5 (2), pp. 146-163; Cian, L., Krishna, A., Elder, R.S., This logo moves me: Dynamic imagery from static images (2014) Journal of Marketing Research, 51 (2), pp. 184-197; Claudy, M.C., Garcia, R., O’Driscoll, A., Consumer resistance to innovation: A behavioral reasoning perspective (2015) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 43 (4), pp. 528-544; Cox, D.N., Evans, G., Construction and validation of a psychometric scale to measure consumers’ fears of novel food technologies: The food technology neophobia scale (2008) Food Quality and Preference, 19 (8), pp. 704-710; Cox, D.S., Locander, W.B., Product novelty: Does it moderate the relationship between ad attitudes and brand attitudes?

This study focuses on solving the problem of player experience with respect to AI controlled gaming agents. The main aim of the study is to develop an intelligent gaming agent by implementing A* Pathfinding and Finite State Machines. For the implementation, Mixamo/Adobe Fuse was used to model the 3D characters (PC and NPCs), the A* Pathfinding component was implemented using a Unity 3D plugin known as “Arongranberg's A* Pathfinding Project”. The FSM component on the other hand was implemented via C# scripts. Unity IDE was used to compile scripts and simulate the game. The end product of this project is a 3rd Person survival shooter 3D game which fully implements the concepts of A* Pathfinding and Finite State Machines. Potentially, this project could be used as a guide to developing games of the same or different genre. With little improvements, the end product of this project (the game) could be made retail ready. © International Research Publication House.","3D; A*; Artificial Intelligent; C#; Finite State Machine; FSM; Game Agent; Mixamo/Adobe Fuse; Pathfinding; Unity IDE",,,,,,,,"Bevilacqua, F., (2013) Finite State Machines: Theory and Implementation, , https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/finite-state-machines-theory-and-mplementation-gamedev-11867, October 24.

There is also keen interest in using these technologies to regulate and optimize the emotional experiences of spaces, such as workplaces, hospitals, prisons, classrooms, travel infrastructures, restaurants, retail and chain stores. Developers frequently claim that their applications do not identify people. Taking the claim at face value, this paper asks, what are the privacy implications of emotional AI practices that do not identify individuals? To investigate privacy perspectives on soft non-identifying emotional AI, the paper draws upon the following: over 100 interviews with the emotion detection industry, legal community, policy-makers, regulators and NGOs interested in privacy; a workshop with stakeholders to design ethical codes for using data about emotions; a UK survey of 2068 citizens on feelings about emotion capture technologies. It finds a weak consensus among social stakeholders on the need for privacy, this driven by different interests and motivations. Given this weak consensus, it concludes that there exists a limited window of opportunity to societally agree principles of practice regarding privacy and the use of data about emotions. © The Author(s) 2020.","Affective computing; biometrics; consensus; data protection; emotional AI; group privacy",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/M006654/1","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council [grant number AH/M006654/1].","Andrejevic, M., (2013) Infoglut: How Too Much Information Is Changing the Way We Think and Know, , New York, Routledge; (2012), http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp193_en.pdf, (,) Opinion 3/2012 on developments biometric technologies. :, (accessed 30 October 2019; Barrett, L.F., Adolphs, R., Marsella, S., Emotional expressions reconsidered: Challenges to inferring emotion from human facial movements (2019) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 20 (1), pp. 1-68; Bertaux, D., (1981), (,) From the life-history aroach to the transformation of sociological practice.

Cognitive computing is represented as a next-generation application AI-based solutions which provide human–machine interaction with personalized interactions and services that imitate human behavior. On the other hand, a large volume of data is generated from smart city applications such as healthcare, smart transportation, retail industry, and firefighting. There is always a concern on how to efficiently manage the large volume of generated data. Recently many existing researches discussed the analysis of the large quantity of data using cognitive computing; however, these researches are failed to handle the certain problems, namely scalability, and flexibility of data gathered in a smart city environment. Data captured from millions of sensors can be cross implemented across various cognitive computing applications to ensure real-time responses. In this paper, we study the cognitive internet of things (CIoT) and propose a CIoT-based smart city network (CIoT-Net) architecture which describes how data gathered from smart city applications can be analyzed using cognitive computing and handle the scalability and flexibility problems. We discuss various technologies such as AI and big data analysis to implement the proposed architecture. Finally, we describe the possible research challenges and opportunities while implementing the proposed architecture. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cognitive computing; Internet of things; Smart city","Behavioral research;

One frequent geospatial decision task is that of location selection, which may involve determining the best site for a new retail store or locating an ideal neighborhood for a future city park. Online and mobile SDSS often do not provide the capability to visualize information using heat maps. Understanding if, and how, heat maps influence the geospatial decision-making process provides an opportunity for SDSS developers to achieve competitive advantages. Such knowledge may also identify individual characteristics needed to effectively utilize heat maps. Scholars can benefit from a more comprehensive understanding of the characteristics that influence geospatial decision-making. Task-Technology Fit Theory (TTFT) provides the theoretical foundation of the study. Subjects (N = 294) participated in an experiment designed to model geospatial decision-making performance with and without the aid of data visualized using heat maps. Individual characteristics and perceptions, including personal innovativeness, self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, relative advantage, and geospatial reasoning ability are examined as direct and indirect antecedents of perceived task-technology fit. Decision-making accuracy, time and satisfaction are measures of decision-performance. A partial least squares structural equation modeling approach reveals the significant influence of an individual's characteristics on decision-making performance. Furthermore, decision-making accuracy is shown to be influenced positively through the use of heat maps. Theoretical and managerial implications, as well as future research directions, are also discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decision-making; Heat maps; Relative advantage; Task technology fit","Artificial intelligence; Competition; Decision support systems; Least squares approximations; Location; Retail stores; Site selection; Future research directions; Heat maps; Individual characteristics; Partial least square (PLS); Relative advantage; Spatial decision support systems; Structural equation modeling; Task technology fit; Decision making; adult; article; consumer; controlled study; decision support system; heat; human; human experiment; major clinical study; motivation; neighborhood; partial least squares regression; self concept; structural equation modeling; theoretical study",,,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Karahanna, E., Time flies when you're having fun: Cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage (2000) MIS Quarterly, 24 (4), pp. 665-694; Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., A conceptual and operational definition of personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology (1998) Information Systems Research, 9 (2), pp. 204-215; Agarwal, R., Sambamurthy, V., Stair, R.M., Research report: The evolving relationship between general and specific computer self-efficacy—an empirical assessment (2000) Information Systems Research, 11 (4), pp. 418-430; Al-Jabri, I.M., Sohail, M.S., Mobile banking adoption: Application of diffusion of innovation theory (2012) Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, 13 (4), pp. 379-391; Albert, W.S., Golledge, R.G., The use of spatial cognitive abilities in geographical information systems: The map overlay operation (1999) Transactions in GIS, 3 (1), pp. 7-21; Aye, Z.C., Jaboyedoff, M., Derron, M.H., van Westen, C.J., Hussin, H.Y., Ciurean, R.L., Pasuto, A., An interactive web-GIS tool for risk analysis: A case study in the fella river basin, Italy (2016) Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 16 (1), pp. 85-101; Bandura, A., Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory (1986), Prentice-Hall, Inc; Bradford, M., Florin, J., Examining the role of innovation diffusion factors on the implementation success of enterprise resource planning systems (2003) International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 4 (3), pp. 205-225; Brewer, C.A., Color use guidelines for mapping (1994) Visualization in Modern Cartography, pp. 123-148; Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., Gosling, S., Amazon's mechanical Turk: A new source of inexpensive, yet high quality, data?

Digital marketing strategies are formulated by the marketing teams in order to increase the traffic on their e-commerce sites, thereby boosting the sales of the products. With the massive amount of data available from the cloud, which were conventionally made with a high degree of intuition based on decision makers’ knowledge and experience, can now be supported with the application of artificial intelligence techniques. This paper introduces a novel approach in applying the fuzzy association rule mining approach and the fuzzy logic technique, for discovering the factors influencing the pricing decision of products launched in e-commerce retail site, and in formulating flexible, dynamic pricing strategies for each product launched in an e-commerce site. A pricing decision support system for B2B e-commerce retail businesses, namely Smart-Quo, is developed and implemented in a Hong Kong-based B2B e-commerce retail company. A six-month pilot run reveals a significant improvement in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness in making pricing decisions on each product. The case study demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefits of applying artificial intelligence techniques in marketing management in today’s digital age. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial intelligence;

Design/methodology/approach: Various forecasting models such as the Box–Jenkins-based auto-regressive integrated moving average model and machine learning-based algorithms such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression, gradient boosting regression (GBR) and extreme GBR (XGBoost/XGBR) were proposed and applied (i.e. modeling, training, testing and predicting) at the retail stage for selected vegetables to forecast demand. The performance analysis (i.e. forecasting error analysis) was carried out to select the appropriate forecasting model at the retail stage for selected vegetables. Findings: From the obtained results for a case environment, it was observed that the machine learning algorithms, namely LSTM and SVR, produced the better results in comparison with other different demand forecasting models. Research limitations/implications: The results obtained from the case environment cannot be generalized. However, it may be used for forecasting of different agriculture produces at the retail stage, capturing their demand environment. Practical implications: The implementation of LSTM and SVR for the case situation at the retail stage will reduce the forecast error, daily retail inventory and fresh produce wastage and will increase the daily revenue. Originality/value: The demand forecasting model selection for agriculture produce at the retail stage on the basis of performance analysis is a unique study where both traditional and non-traditional models were analyzed and compared. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence;

The new retail has been one of the most successful modes. Different from the traditional business modes, it is driven by information technology (big data, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, etc.) and centered on consumer experience. Furthermore, it reconstructs the core elements in online and offline trade to form a new business mode. Thus, the existing business modeling approaches cannot be used to analyze and describe the new retail mode. In this article, we first analyze the business characteristics and processes in new retail and redefine the core elements in e-commerce, such as people, product, and place. EMB can decouple the business aspect and technical aspect of the business systems of e-commerce. So EMB can bridge the gap between business experts and application developers. In addition, we verify EMB by the electronic certificate business of Taobao and deeply analyze its reusability, applicability, and efficiency. Finally, to demonstrate the advantages of EMB, it is compared with some other existing methods in detail. © 2014 IEEE.","Business modeling; business process; e-commerce; new retail","Electronic commerce; Reusability; Systems engineering; Application developers; Business aspects; Business modeling; Business Process; Business systems; new retail; Retail business; Technical aspects; Sales",,,,,"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program): 2017YFB1400601

Consumer products can now be deeply customized to an individual both in terms of fit, as well as style. However, consumers typically lack the design tools and expertise to express their design intent. In this article, we explore a human-centered approach for leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to scaffold 3-D design tasks to make them accessible to more consumers. Our sunglasses kiosk prototype allows users to iteratively express their design intent at a high-level, using voice. The AI generates new 3-D designs of sunglasses that reflect the user's refined design intent. A user study examines the attitudes and behaviors toward this AI-powered kiosk approach. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",,"Consumer products; Gas generators; Glass; Scaffolds; Sun; Ubiquitous computing; Cats; Design intent; Digital manufacturing; Generative model; Kiosk approach; Prototypes; Speech input; Threedimensional (3-d); Artificial intelligence",,,,,,,"Schön, D., Bennett, J., Reflective conversation with materials (1996) Bringing Design to Software, pp. 171-189. , T.

This paper explores the optimal sizing options for batteries in microgrids that include wind turbines, solar photovoltaics, synchronous machines and a grid connection supply under various types of retail tariff schemes. The optimal size of batteries is hypothesized to be significantly related to the intelligent control rules applied to dispatch the microgrid sources. This problem can be formulated as a mixed linear integer problem and can be solved using linear/non-linear solvers depending on the complexity of the generation control plan. The main objective of this work is to apply online intelligent adaptation mechanism to tune the economic generation control (dispatch) rules of the microgrid. This tuning objectives are maintaining secure operation, maximizing profitable utilization of batteries and managing their charging life-cycles. While sizing options exploration has been formulated as a linear programming based optimization problem, Fuzzy-Logic is proposed to control the charging/discharging time and quantity for batteries. For the sake of performance comparison, various optimization techniques, i.e., Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithm and Flower Pollination Algorithm are applied to perform the economic dispatch calculation. As a case study, a commercial type load connected to the 22 kV distribution network in south Western Australia was used in the testing and validation if the results of the proposed sizing method. The operation condition data was obtained from Western Power the distribution and transmission company in south Western Australia, the Australian Bureau Of Meteorology (BOM) and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). The results showed that employing intelligent batteries in operation can reduce the annual generation cost of microgrids. However, the decision on selecting the size of batteries depends heavily on the amount of upfront investment cost. The simulation results showed that the intelligence added to batteries’ control could achieve 6.5%, 7.6% and 11.5% of the annual generation cost in the Islanded, Grid-connected with no-export and Grid-connected with export operating modes respectively. Also, intelligent batteries operation control was proven to minimize their payback time to 2.8, 2.7 and 2.7 years in the Islanded, Grid-connected with no-export and Grid-connected with export operating modes respectively. © 2019","Artificial intelligence;

In association with needs, these preferences define a customer’s behavior towards goods or services. In recent years, there has been a tremendous shift in customer behavior and the reason for the same can be attributed to the digital technologies. These technologies are compelling the businesses to rapidly change to remain relevant in the market. On the supply side, Social media, Mobility, Artificial Intelligence, Analytics or Big Data, Cloud infrastructure, IoT, Augmented reality and Virtual reality (AR/VR) are creating opportunities for existing enterprises to transform as well as new pure digital enterprises to be born. On the demand side, it's vital to understand the impact these technologies have on customer preferences for the appropriate marketing strategy to be developed. The same technologies are available to customers too in some form or other. This paper looks at the impact of the disruptive digital technologies on customer preferences and the resulting change in customer behaviour at two levels. It captures the results of the study on customer preferences towards online shopping. It also elaborates on the changes in the preferences with digital technologies. It clubs the customer preferences in three groups aligned with phases in purchase process. The paper also looks at the possible future evolution of technology and its impact on customer preferences. In this paper, intrinsic considerations are for the retail industry. Retail firms in this day and age have a golden opportunity to use technology to understand consumers in more meaningful ways. © BEIESP.","Customer preference; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; ECommerce",,,,,,,,"Tripsas, M., Customer Preference Discontinuities: A Trigger for Radical Technological Change, , www.interscience.wiley.com; Foroudia, P., Gupta, S., Sivaraja, U., Amanda Broderick: Investigating the Effects of Smart Technology on Customer Dynamics and Customer Experience, , https://www.sciencedirect.com; Tripsas, M., Customer Preference Discontinuities: A Trigger for Radical Technological Change, , www.interscience.wiley.com; Su, B., The Evolution of Consumer Behavior in the Digital Age, , www.medium.com; Changing Gears 2020: How Digital is Transforming the Face of the Automotive Industry, , https://www.bain.com/insights/changing-gears-2020/; Consumer Behavior: Building Marketing Strategy, , 12th Edition by Delbert; Hawkins and David Mothersbaugh Synchrony Financial (2015) Fifth Annual Major Purchase Consumer Study, 5. , Dec; Kearney, A.T., The Consumers of the Future: Influence Vs, , Affluence,www.atkearney.com; Kearney, A.T., Two Perspectives on Consumers of the Future, , www.atkearney.com; Najdic, M., Using Multiple Senses in Service Experience creating Customer Loyalty in Tourism (2011) International Journal of Management Cases, 13 (3), pp. 18-23; Kim, H., Park, K., Schwarz, N., Will this Trip really be Exciting?

The success achieved in sectors like industry and retail and the huge expectations aroused by the implementation of this technology in other areas, such as politics and healthcare, have encouraged the idea that it might even be possible to find a better way of working out what is good and fair in the algorithmic analysis and processing of Big Data concerning morality drawn from hyperconnected individuals.

E-commerce channel (e-channel) has become an important retail channel. The multi-period closed-loop supply chain network of electronic channels (E-CLSCN) is studied. Moreover, this study considers the influence of consumers' preference for products and artificial intelligence push (AI-push) on network balance under the conditions of dynamic and static. The network consists of manufacturers, remanufacturers, and demandmarkets. Remanufacturers are responsible for collecting andremanufacturing. Themulti-period E-CLSCN model is established through variational inequalities. The study finds that whether dynamic or static, consumers' preference for new products (NP) has positively correlated with the profits of manufacturers and the whole E-CLSCN. Consumers' preference for remanufacturer products (RP) has only positively correlated with the profits of remanufactures. In the aspect of AI-push, the manufacturers' AI-push has positively correlated with the profits of the entire players of E-CLSCN, while the remanufacturers'AI-push has only positively correlatedwith the profits of the remanufacturers. Also, considering the multi-period, the sensitivity of the demand markets for the investment of manufacturers' and remanufacturers' AI-push gradually reduces, and the marginal benefit of AI-push gradually decreases. Finally, this paper addresses interesting managerial insights from the perspective of government and enterprises. Under the dual objectives of environmental protection and economic interests of enterprises, this study provides a reference for governments and enterprises to develop relevant dynamic policies. Namely, the government formulates dynamic environmental protection measures, and enterprises formulate dynamic strategic plans and implement government policies. While promoting the management level of E-CLSCN, it effectively boosts the development of the remanufacturing industry and recycling sustainable economy. © 2019 by the authors.","AI-push; Consumers' preference for products; E-commerce channel (e-channel); Multi-period e-channel closed-loop supply chain network (E-CLSCN); Sustainable development",,,,,,,,"Govindan, K., Soleimani, H., Kannan, D., Reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chain: A comprehensive review to explore the future (2015) Eur.

Furthermore, with the Physical Internet and highly efficient, interconnected networks, goods can be delivered fast and reliably, enabling the showcasing model to be an integral part of the supply chain. Goods do not need be stored in retail shops anymore as they can be shipped from available connected sources. Such changes accentuate the role of showcasing, and a decision support system to optimize the showcase that best meet customer's expectation is needed. We thus propose a model for measuring and optimizing the showcasing value for a retailer, specifically focusing on recreational vehicle dealerships as an illustrative example. Even when the exact desired features are not available, the customer can gain partial confidence from similar features. We first introduce the concept of showcasing value. The showcasing optimization problem is then formulated as a mixed integer programming problem, where the objective function maximizes the sum of showcase representation value for all features in the showroom, given the feature demand shares and the weight of the feature categories. Computational experiments are conducted with data from the industry, focusing on dealerships in a region in United Sates. Our results indicate that a significant increase in the showcasing value can be achieved through an optimized showcase with little or no extra budget. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

This research sets out to conceptualize and test a multi-dimensional Service Robot Integration Willingness (SRIW) Scale that uncovers the key dimensions characterizing consumers’ long-term willingness to integrate artificial intelligence and service robots into regular service transactions. Drawing on a five-stage scale development procedure, a 36-item six-dimensional SRIW scale was developed, which includes performance efficacy, intrinsic motivation, anthropomorphism, social influence, facilitating condition, and emotions. The SRIW scale demonstrates rigorous psychometric properties per findings of construct validity and reliability tests, and invariance analysis across four service industries (e.g., hotels, restaurants, airlines, and retail stores) where service robots have already been or are likely to be launched. Theoretical and managerial implications of the SRIW scale and directions for future research are elaborated. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Scale development; Service robots; Technology integration; Validation",,,,,,,,"Ackerman, E., Study: nobody wants social robots that look like humans because they threaten our identity (2016) IEEE Spectr., pp. 1-5; Adkins, N.R., Ozanne, J.L., The low literate consumer (2005) J.

This proposed LEM does not aim to replace any existing energy service or become the best market model; but instead to diversify the energy ecosystem at the edge of distribution networks. In light of this philosophy, the market mechanism will provide additional options for customers and prosumers who have the willingness to directly participate in the retail electricity market occasionally, on top of using existing utility services. It also helps in improving market efficiency and encouraging local-level power balance, while taking into account the characteristics of customers' behavior. The energy trading process will be built as a Markov decision process with some reinforcement learning and data-driven methods applied. Some economic concepts, like search friction, related to this kind of typical search cost involved market model are also discussed. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","energy trading; Event-driven market; Markov decision process; reinforcement learning","Buildings; Distributed computer systems; Ecosystems; Electric utilities; Electronic trading; Industry; Markov processes; Power markets; Reinforcement learning; Sales; Energy trading; Event-driven; Learning (artificial intelligence); Markov Decision Processes; Peer-to-peer computing; Commerce",,,,,,"Manuscript received January 26, 2018; revised April 16, 2018 and May 28, 2018; accepted July 11, 2018.

Following this, the domain of retail can be sketched as a natural fit for the application of AI tools, which are known for their high proportion of human work and concurrent low profit margins. This paper aims to explore the current dissemination of the application of AI within the industry. The value-added core tasks of retail companies are examined to determine the possible utilization and the market adoption within the globally largest retail companies is given. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses two different approaches to identify the scientific state-of-the-art: a search on the major scientific databases and an empirical study of the ten largest international retail companies and their adoption of AI technologies in the domains of wholesale and retail. Findings: The application within the different value-added core tasks varies greatly depending on the area. In summary, there are numerous possible applications in all areas. Especially, in areas where future forecasts are needed within the task areas (such as marketing or replenishment), the use of AI, today, is both scientifically and practically highly developed. In contrast, the market adoption of AI is highly variable. The pioneers have integrated extensive applications into everyday business, while the challengers are investing heavily in new initiatives. Some others, however, show neither active use nor any effort to adopt such technology. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is one of the first research contributions to analyze the areas of application and the impact of AI structured along the value-added core processes of retail companies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence;

These advancements continue to have profound impact on business processes across the entire organisation. As such, Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LSCM) are also leveraging benefits from digitisation, allowing organisations to increase efficiency and productivity, whilst also providing greater transparency and accuracy in the movement of goods. While the warehouse is a key component within LSCM, warehousing research remains an understudied area within overall supply chain research, accounting for only a fraction of the overall research within this field. However, of the extant warehouse research, attention has largely been placed on warehouse design, performance and technology use, yet overlooking the determinants of Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption within warehouses. Accordingly, through proposing an extension of the Technology–Organisation–Environment (TOE) framework, this research explores the barriers and opportunities of AI within the warehouse of a major retailer. The findings for this qualitative study reveal AI challenges resulting from a shortage of both skill and mind-set of operational management, while also uncovering the opportunities presented through existing IT infrastructure and pre-existing AI exposure of management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Logistics; Technology readiness; Warehousing","Artificial intelligence; Logistics; Supply chain management; Business Process; IT infrastructures; Logistics and supply chain management; Operational management; Qualitative study; Retail distribution; Technology readiness; Warehousing; Warehouses",,,,,,,"Aboelmaged, M.G., Predicting e-readiness at firm-level: An analysis of technological, organizational and environmental (TOE) effects on e-maintenance readiness in manufacturing firms (2014) International Journal of Information Management, 34 (5), pp. 639-651; Ajzen, I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior (1985), Springer Berlin; Angeles, R., Anticipated IT infrastructure and supply chain integration capabilities for RFID and their associated deployment outcomes (2009) International Journal of Information Management, 29 (3), pp. 219-231; Arooj, A., Mufti, M., Jamal, H., Collaborative communication of active RFID tags for warehouse asset management (2011) IJCSNS, 11 (2), pp. 39-46; Autor, D.H., Why are there still so many jobs?

Retailing is one of the pillars of the Indian economy. About 10% of India’s GDP comes from the retail industry. With the advent of digital transformation in the Indian economy and adoption of smart city initiatives, there is a need for the retail sector to shift from the traditional retailing to smart retailing. Smart technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things are being used globally in the retail sector. But India is still lagging behind in this initiative. In academic literature, very few studies have focussed on the role of technologies in smart retailing. So the objective of this paper is to understand the role of smart technologies like AI and IOT and its impact on the retail sector. The study adopts the case study approach wherein various use cases from the retail sector have been analysed with respect to adoption of AI and IoT technologies and its benefit for smarter retailing. Potential technologies for smart retailing in the area of AI and IOT which can be applied in India have also been discussed. The study will be useful to the practitioners in the field of AI and IoT technologies to create customized solutions for the retail sector; to the academicians as it adds to the literature on adoption of technology in retail sector; and the society at large will be benefitted as customers will get better delivery, better service and better customer experience. ©BEIESP.","AI; Digitization; IoT; Smart Communication; Smart Retailing",,,,,,,,"Kapoor, A.V., Khanna, P., Analysis of Global Retail Industry: An Overview of Changing Trends (2016) International Journal of Research in IT and Management, 6 (12), pp. 73-78. , http://euroasiapub.org, December-2016, Available online at, Accessed on 13th May 2019; Beecham Research (2016) The Future of Retail through the Internet of Things, , https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/future-retail-through-iot-paper.pdf, Online, Accessed on 13th May 2019; (2018) 2019 Media & Entertainment Industry Outlook, , https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-mediaand-telecommunications/articles/media-and-entertainmentindustry-outlook-trends.html, Online, Accessed on 13th May 2019; Tzafestas, S.G., Synergy of IoT and AI in Modern Society: The Robotics and Automation Case (2018) Robotics and Automation Engineering Journal, 3 (5). , file:///C:/Users/HPPC/Downloads/Synergy_of_IoT_and_AI_in_Modern_Society%20(3).pdf; Trends, R., (2018) Global Retail Trends, , https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2018/03/globalretail-trends-2018.pdf, Accessed on 13th May 2019; A T Kearney Report China’s Smart Retailing Pays Off, , https://www.atkearney.com/documents/20152/1332492/Chinas+Smart+Retailing+Pays+Off.pdf/c16fafc1-6a37-60aa-3ac225dd63dc5fac, Online, Accessed on 13th May 2019; Zhao, L., Li, L., Analysis of Operational Benefits of Unmanned Retail Business Form based on DEA Method (2018) Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, Volume, 68, pp. 109-113. , file:///C:/Users/HP-PC/Downloads/SSMI123%20(1).pdf, [Online]., (Accessed on 13th May 2019; Wietfeld, C., Schmutzler, J., Hägerling, C., A Smart Communication Infrastructure for Future Energy System Applications Future Internet Symposium 2009 International Workshop on the Future Internet of Things and Services-Embedded Web Services for Pervasive Devices, , file:///C:/Users/HPPC/Downloads/A_Smart_Communication_Infrastructure_for_Future_En.pdf, Online, Accessed on 13th May 2019; Lloret, S.C., (2015) A Smart Communication Architecture for Ambient Assisted Living, , file:///C:/Users/HPPC/Downloads/AsmartcommunicationarchitectureforAALv6.pdf, Accessed on 13th May 2019; Lloret, J., Canovas, A., Sendra, S., Parra, L., A Smart Communication Architecture for Ambient Assisted Living.

The aim of this paper is to create a three-class model that can improve credit risk assessment in the microfinance context. The real-world microcredit data set used in this study includes data from retail, micro, and small enterprises. To the best of the authors' knowledge, existing research on microfinance credit scoring has been limited to regression and genetic algorithms, thereby excluding novel machine learning algorithms. The aim of this research is to close this gap. The proposed models predict default events by analysing different ensemble classification methods that empower the effects of the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) used in the preprocessing of the imbalanced microcredit data set. Initial results have shown improvement in the prediction results for certain classes when the oversampling technique with homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble classifier methods was applied. A prediction improvement for all classes was achieved via application of SMOTE and the Consolidated Trees Construction algorithm together with Rotation Forest. To obtain a complete view of all aspects, an additional set of metrics is used in the evaluation of performance. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","credit scoring; data mining; decision support system; ensemble classifiers; microcredit data set; synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems; Finance; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Consolidated trees construction algorithms; Credit scoring; Data set; Decision support models; Ensemble classification; Ensemble classifiers; Heterogeneous ensembles; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Classification (of information)",,,,,,"This research has been supported by Info Studio d.o.o, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.","Ala'raj, M., Abbod, M.F., A new hybrid ensemble credit scoring model based on classifiers consensus system approach (2016) Expert Systems with Applications, 64, pp. 36-55. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2016.07.017; Aličković, E., Subasi, A., Breast cancer diagnosis using GA feature selection and Rotation Forest (2015) Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-11; Baesens, B.V., Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring (2003) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 54 (6), pp. 627-635. , https://doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601545; Barandela, R., Sánchez, J.S., Garcıa, V., Rangel, E., Strategies for learning in class imbalance problems (2003) Pattern Recognition, 36 (3), pp. 849-851. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0031-3203(02)00257-1; Batista, G.E., Prati, R.C., Monard, M.C., A study of the behavior of several methods for balancing machine learning training data (2004) ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter, 6 (1), pp. 20-29. , https://doi.org/10.1145/1007730.1007735; Baum, E.B., On the capabilities of multilayer perceptrons (1998) Journal of Complexity, 4, pp. 193-215; Bee Wah Yap, S.H., Using data mining to improve assessment of credit worthiness via credit scoring models (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38, pp. 13274-13283. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2011.04.147; Bishop, C.M., (1995) Neural networks for pattern recognition, , Birmingham, UK, CLARENDON PRESS, Oxford; Blagus, R., SMOTE for high-dimensional class-imbalanced data (2013) BMC Bioinformatics, 14 (1), p. 106. , https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-106, Retrieved from; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45, pp. 5-32. , https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1010933404324; Caruana, R., Niculescu-Mizil, A., An empirical comparison of supervised learning algorithms (2006) Proc. of the 23rd Intern.

Design/methodology/approach: Grounded theory approach has been used to develop the Vroom’s expectancy theory. Initially data were collected through participant interviews using theoretical sampling. These data were analyzed and coded using the three step process, i.e. open coding, axial coding and selective coding. The categories created during coding were integrated to generate Vroom’s expectancy theory of motivation. Findings: The findings indicate that Vroom’s expectancy theory of motivation can be used to explain motivation of young consumers to use AI tools as an aid in taking shopping decisions. The motivation may be intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation or force choice motivation. Expectancy represents the ease of using the tools, instrumentality represents competence of tools in performing desired tasks while valence represents satisfaction, rewarding experience and trust in using of tools. Research limitations/implications: The findings of the study are based on grounded theory approach which is an inductive approach. Alternate research methodologies, both inductive and deductive, need to be employed to strengthen the external validity and generalize the results. The study is limited to shopping motives of young consumers in India. A comparison with other consumer motivational studies has not been done. Hence no claim is made regarding the advantage of Vroom’s theory over other motivational theories. Practical implications: The study has strong implications for retailers in developing countries which are seen as an emerging market for retail and have introduced AI tools in recent years. The Vroom’s expectancy theory will help retailers to understand consumer motivation in using AI tools or shopping. Originality/value: Vroom’s expectancy theory to understand consumer motivation to use AI tools in shopping was generated using the grounded theory approach. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Consumer motivation; Grounded theory; India; Retail; Vroom’s expectancy theory",,,,,,"Indian Council of Social Science Research, ICSSR","Dr Komal Chopra is Assistant Professor of Retailing and Consumer Behaviour at Symbiosis Institute of Management Studies, Symbiosis International (Deemed University), Pune, India.

Machine learning (ML) is a discipline within AI that deals with learning improvement based on data. Subsequently, retailing and wholesaling, which are known for their high proportion of human work and at the same time low profit margins, can be regarded as a natural fit for the application of AI and ML tools. This article examines the current prevalence of the use of machine learning in the industry. The paper uses two disparate approaches to identify the scientific and practical state-of-the-art within the domain: a literature review on the major scientific databases and an empirical study of the 10 largest international retail companies and their adoption of ML technologies in the domain are combined with each other. This text does not present a prototype using machine learning techniques. Instead of a consideration and comparison of the particular algorythms and approaches, the underling problems and operational tasks that are elementary for the specific domain are identified. Based on a comprehensive literature review the main problem types that ML can serve, and the associated ML techniques, are evaluated. An empirical study of the 10 largest retail companies and their ML adoption shows that the practical market adoption is highly variable. The pioneers have extensively integrated applications into everyday business, while others only show a small set of early prototypes. However, some others show neither active use nor efforts to apply such a technology. Following this, a structured approach is taken to analyze the value-adding core processes of retail companies. The current scientific and practical application scenarios and possibilities are illustrated in detail. In summary, there are numerous possible applications in all areas. In particular, in areas where future forecasts and predictions are needed (like marketing or replenishment), the use of ML today is both scientifically and practically highly developed. © 2019 by the authors.

Business continuity management (BCM) forms part of supply chain risk management and is an important competitive factor for companies by ensuring the smooth functioning of critical business processes in the case of failures. If business operations are severely disrupted, the companies’ decision maker is confronted with a situation which is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, complexity and time pressure. In such a context, decision support can be of significant value. This article presents a novel decision support methodology which leads to an improved and more robust BCM for severe disruptions caused by disasters. The methodology is part of the Reactive Disaster and supply chain Risk decision Support System (ReDRiSS) to deal with different levels of information availability and to provide decision makers with a robust decision recommendation regarding resource allocation problems. It combines scenario techniques, optimization models and approaches from decision theory to operate in an environment characterized by sparse or lacking information and dynamic changes over time. A simulation case study is presented where the methodology is applied within the BCM of a food retail company in Berlin that is affected by a pandemic disaster. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Business continuity management; Decision support system; Disaster management; Risk management; Robust decision-making","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Risk assessment; Risk management; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Business continuity management; Degree of uncertainty; Disaster management; Information availability; Resource allocation problem; Robust decisions; Supply chain risk management; Systematic identification; Decision making",,,,,"Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","We would like to thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for financial support for this work within the research project SEAK.","Knemeyer, A.M., Zinn, W., Eroglu, C., Proactive planning for catastrophic events in supply chains (2009) Journal of Operations Management, 27 (2), pp. 141-153; Schätter, F., Wiens, M., Schultmann, F., A new focus on risk reduction: an ad-hoc decision support system for humanitarian relief logistics (2015) Ecosystem Health and Sustainability, 1 (3), pp. 1-11; Samii, R., Van Wassenhove, L., The Logistics of Emergency Response: Tsunami Versus Haiti (2010), INSEAD, Social Innovation Centre; The White House, The Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina: Lessons Learned (2006); Guha-Sapir, D., Hoyois, P., Below, R., Annual Disaster Statistical Review 2015: The Numbers and Trends (2016), Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED); Kleindorfer, P.R., Saad, G.H., Managing disruption risks in supply chains (2005) Production and Operations Management, 14 (1), pp. 53-68; Van Wassenhove, L., Humanitarian logistics and supply chain management (2012) Humanitarian Logistics, SpringerBriefs in Business, pp. 5-16. , A.

Design/methodology/approach: A GIRP mathematical model is first constructed to help this specific publishing logistics firm to approximate to the optimal distribution system design. Next, two modified Heuristic-Tabu combination methods that combine savings approach, 2-opt and 1-1 λ-interchange heuristic approach with two modified Tabu search methods are developed to determine the optimum solution. Findings: Several examples are given to illustrate the optimum total inventory routing cost, the optimum delivery routes, the economic order quantities, the optimum service levels, the reorder points, the optimum common review interval and the optimum maximum inventory levels of all convenience stores in these designed routes. Sensitivity analyses are conducted based on the parameters including truck loading capacity, inventory carrying cost percentages, unit shortage costs, unit ordering costs and unit transport costs to support optimal distribution system design regarding the total inventory routing cost and GHG emission level. Originality/value: The most important finding is that GIRP model with reordering point inventory control policy should be applied for the first replenishment and delivery run and GIRP model with periodic review inventory control policy should be conducted for the remaining replenishment and delivery runs based on overall simulation results. The other very important finding concerning the global warming issue can help decision makers of GIRP distribution system to select the appropriate type of truck to deliver products to all retail stores located in the planned optimal delivery routes depending on GHG emission consumptions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-opt and 1-1 λ-interchange heuristic method;

In the physical sciences this encapsulates the study of the cosmos, including e.g. dark matter and dark energy, gravitational waves, and black holes, and of elementary particles, including e.g. the Higgs boson, the quark-gluon plasma and new physics beyond the Standard Model. Dynamics at small length scales is determined by the rules of quantum mechanics, rather than classical – Newtonian – mechanics, which introduces an intrinsic indeterminacy in the problem, following the usual probabilistic interpretation. Understanding complex quantum systems, quantum control and quantum information is highly relevant for the paradigm of quantum computing, which surpasses classical computing algorithms in a dramatic fashion and, once available, will make previously incomputable problems solvable. Phase transitions, such as the transition between ice and water, or between magnetic and non-magnetic phases in materials, are manifestations of collective behaviour emerging from simple laws. Order parameters, e.g. the net magnetisation of a material, display the presence or absence of macroscopic order and are connected to the underlying pattern of symmetry breaking, linking phase transitions to the microscopic laws of Nature in a precise way.","Abarca-Alvarez, F.J., Campos-Sanchez, F.S., Reinoso-Bellido, R., Demographic and dwelling models by artificial intelligence: Urban renewal opportunities in spanish coast (2018) International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning, 13 (7), pp. 941-953; Abbot, J., Marohasy, J., The potential benefits of using artificial intelligence for monthly rainfall forecasting for the Bowen Basin, Queensland, Australia (2013) WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment, 171, pp. 287-297; Acemoglu, D., Autor, D., Dorn, D., Hanson, G., Price, B., Return of the Solow Paradox?

To understand an intention of a customer on reasons to make a churn as well time taken by a customer to churn is always an unknown mystery. Though good numbers of research works have suggested works on customer churn an exact measure of accurate churn and approaches to suggest on retention is the major discussion of this paper. Traditional approaches such as ACO, PSO are supports on appreciable churn prediction but consider more time to converge, whereas GWO algorithm supports with minimal time to converge as well improved accuracy of 89.26% along with actual churn match compared to PSO and ACO approaches.

To tackle shelf-OOS that plagues customers, retailers, and suppliers, we develop a decision support model for managers who aim to fix the recurring issue of shelf-OOS through data-driven audits. Specifically, we propose a point-of-sale (POS) data analytics approach and use consecutive zero sales observations in POS data as signals to develop an optimal audit policy. The proposed model considers relevant cost factors, conditional probability of shelf-OOS, and conditional expectation of shelf-OOS duration. We then analyze the impact of relevant cost factors, stochastic transition from non-OOS to OOS, zero sale probability of the underlying demand, managers’ perceived OOS likelihood, and even random fixes of shelf-OOS on optimal decisions. We also uncover interesting dynamics between decisions, costs, and probability estimates. After analyzing model behaviors, we perform extensive simulations to validate the economic utility of the proposed data-driven audits, which can be a cost-efficient complement to existing shelf inventory control. We further outline implementation details for the sake of model validation. Particularly, we use Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo to develop an estimation framework that ensures all model parameters are empirically grounded. We conclude by articulating practical and theoretical implications of our data-driven audit policy design for retail managers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Audits; Data analytics; Decision support systems; Point-of-sale; Shelf out-of-stock","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Costs; Decision support systems; Inference engines; Inventory control; Managers; Markov processes; Sales; Stochastic systems; Audits; Conditional expectation; Conditional probabilities; Data analytics; Decision support models; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Out of stock; Point of sale; Cost benefit analysis",,,,,,,"Aastrup, J., Kotzab, H., Forty years of out-of-stock research – And shelves are still empty (2010) The International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research, 20 (1), pp. 147-164; Brooks, S.P., Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and its application (1998) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series D (The Statistician), 47 (1), pp. 69-100; Cachon, G., What is interesting in operations management (2012) Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, 14 (2), pp. 166-169; Chuang, H.H., Mathematical modeling and Bayesian estimation for error-prone shelf audits (2015) Decision Support Systems, 80, pp. 72-82; Chuang, H.H., Oliva, R., Inventory record inaccuracy: Causes and labor effects (2015) Journal of Operations Management, 39-40, pp. 63-78; Chuang, H.H., Oliva, R., Liu, S., On-shelf availability, retail performance, and external audits: A field experiment (2016) Production and Operations Management, 25 (5), pp. 935-951; Condea, C., Thiesse, F., Fleisch, E., RFID-enabled shelf replenishment with backroom monitoring in retail stores (2012) Decision Support Systems, 52, pp. 839-849; DeHoratius, N., Raman, A., Inventory record inaccuracy: An empirical analysis (2008) Management Science, 54 (4), pp. 627-641; DeHoratius, N., Mersereau, A.J., Schrage, L., Retail inventory management when records are inaccurate (2008) Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, 10 (2), pp. 257-277; Dudley, R., Wal-mart sees $3 billion opportunity refilling empty shelves (2014), http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-28/wal-mart-says-refilling-empty-shelves-is-3-billion-opportunity.html, Bloomberg News; Fisher, M.L., Raman, A., The new science of retailing: How analytics are transforming the supply chain and improving performance (2010), Harvard Business Press Boston; Greenhouse, S., Tabuchi, H., (2014), http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/business/walmart-memo-orders-stores-to-improve-grocery-performance.html?_r=0, Wal-mart memo orders stores to improve grocery performance.

A dataset for person re-identification TVPR (Top View Person Re-Identification) based on a number of significant features derived from both depth and color images has been previously built. This dataset uses an RGB-D camera in a top-view configuration to extract anthropometric features for the recognition of people in view of the camera, reducing the problem of occlusions while being privacy preserving. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning method for person re-identification using the TVPR dataset. In particular, we propose the combination of multiple k-nearest neighbor classifiers based on different distance functions and feature subsets derived from depth and color images. Moreover, the neighborhood component feature selection is used to learn the depth features’ weighting vector by minimizing the leave-one-out regularized training error. The classification process is performed by selecting the first passage under the camera for training and using the others as the testing set. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology outperforms standard supervised classifiers widely used for the re-identification task. This improvement encourages the application of this approach in the retail context in order to improve retail analytics, customer service and shopping space management. © 2018 by the authors.

This paper proposes a dynamic pricing DR algorithm for energy management in a hierarchical electricity market that considers both service provider's (SP) profit and customers’ (CUs) costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) is used to illustrate the hierarchical decision-making framework, in which the dynamic pricing problem is formulated as a discrete finite Markov decision process (MDP), and Q-learning is adopted to solve this decision-making problem. Using RL, the SP can adaptively decide the retail electricity price during the on-line learning process where the uncertainty of CUs’ load demand profiles and the flexibility of wholesale electricity prices are addressed. Simulation results show that this proposed DR algorithm, can promote SP profitability, reduce energy costs for CUs, balance energy supply and demand in the electricity market, and improve the reliability of electric power systems, which can be regarded as a win-win strategy for both SP and CUs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Demand response; Dynamic pricing; Markov decision process; Q-learning; Reinforcement learning","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Commerce; Computer aided software engineering; Cost reduction; Decision making; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Power markets; Profitability; Reinforcement learning; Decision-making problem; Demand response; Dynamic pricing; Finite Markov decision process; Hierarchical electricity market; Markov Decision Processes; Q-learning; Reinforcement learning approach; Smart power grids; adaptive management; algorithm; artificial intelligence; cost analysis; decision making; demand analysis; electrical power; electricity; energy market; energy planning; information and communication technology; price determination; smart grid",,,,,"Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning, KETEP

Some of these decisions are relatively simple, such as a selecting a jam or a coffee, where the choice is entirely subjective. Others, such as investment decision-making, are risky, complex, consequential, and there is a normatively optimal choice. Seeking advice from an expert is a reasonable solution in these circumstances, and yet a minority of investors turn to a professional for advice. As an alternative to human advisors, technology is increasingly being harnessed to provide effective and low-cost advice to assist consumers in making decisions. In a retail context, these are shop bots and search engines often used on a mobile phone while shopping. In an investment context, these are frequently referred to as “robo-advisors”. Examining consumer intention to seek advice in an investment context, the current study demonstrates that, among numerous factors examined, unfounded confidence was the best indicator of consumer reluctance to seek advice. Robo-advisors, as artificial intelligence agents providing financial literacy instruction and impartial expert advice, may offer a solution. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Advice; Confidence; Consumer financial decision-making; Objective knowledge; Subjective knowledge",,,,,,,,"London: Printed for T.

Weather data have long been considered a crucial external data input in practitioners’ marketing strategy; however, academic research on how weather conditions affect consumer behaviors has been limited. To fill this gap, this research investigates how weather parameters, including sunlight, temperature, and air quality, can be incorporated into MDSS to predict consumers’ variety-seeking in their purchases using public weather data and supermarket panel data for five typical retail products. Our analyses show that weather conditions are associated with greater variety-seeking behavior. The results afford insights into how to exploit weather data for data analytics and employ weather targeting strategies to save promotional expenses and increase profitability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China big data; Data analytics; Marketing decision support system; Mehrabian-Russell model; Variety-seeking; Weather data","Air quality; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Consumer behavior; Decision support systems; Marketing; Meteorology; Academic research; Business effectiveness; Data analytics; Marketing decision; Marketing strategy; Variety-seeking; Weather data; Weather parameters; Big data",,,,,"20150402

These are mathematical models that calculate how demand varies at different price levels, then combine that data with information on costs and inventory levels to recommend prices that will improve revenue and profits. These models have been around for a while-so what is different now? We have identified three important changes: (1) Data: availability of internal and external real-time data such as traffic to a website, consumers making buy/no buy decisions and competitor pricing strategies; (2) Analytics: advances in machine learning and ease of access (R, Python) have enabled the development of systems that learn on the fly about consumer behaviour and preferences and generate effective estimates of demand-price relationships; and (3) Automation: increase in computing speed enables real-time optimisation of prices of hundreds of competing products sold by the same retailer. We take advantage of these new opportunities by showing how they were applied at Boston-based flash sales retailer Rue La La, online market maker Groupon, and the largest online retailer in Latin America, B2W Digital (B2W). While all these examples are of on-line businesses which have readily available data and can change prices dynamically, we have also implemented similar methods for brick-and-mortar retailed in applications such as promotional pricing, new product introduction, and assortment optimisation with similar business impacts. Thus, beyond applications to price optimisations, these new trends enable companies to revolutionise their business from procurement to supply chain all the way to revenue management. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","analytics; forecasting; machine learning; online retail; price theory","Artificial intelligence; Competition; Computation theory; Economics; Electronic commerce; Forecasting; Learning systems; Optimization; Real time systems; Sales; Supply chains; analytics; Inventory levels; New product introductions; Online retails; Price optimisation; Price theory; Pricing strategy; Revenue management; Costs",,,,,,,"Cheung, W.C., Simchi-Levi, D., Wang, H., Technical Note–Dynamic Pricing and Demand Learning with Limited Price Experimentation (2017) Operations Research, 65 (6), pp. 1722-1731; Ferreira, K.J., Lee, B.H.A., Simchi-Levi, D., (2015) Analytics in Online Flash Sales: Demand Forecasting and Price Optimization, , https://www.informs.org/Blogs/M-SOM-Blogs/M-SOM-Review/Analytics-in-Online-Flash-Sales-Demand-Forecasting-and-Price-Optimization, M&SOM Blogs–M&SOM Review, Informs, and; Ferreira, K.J., Lee, B.H.A., Simchi-Levi, D., Analytics for an Online Retailer: Demand Forecasting and Price Optimization (2016) Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, 18 (1), pp. 69-88; Özer, Ö., Phillips, R., (2012) The Oxford handbook of pricing management, , Oxford: Oxford University Press, and, eds; Simchi-Levi, D., (2017) Sloan Management Review, , http://mitsmr.com/2wLL0xb; Talluri, K.T., Van Ryzin, G.J., (2006) The Theory and Practice of Revenue Management, 68. , New York: Springer Science & Business Media, and","Simchi-Levi, D.; Operations Research Center, Institute for Data, Systems and Society, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyUnited States; email: dslevi@mit.edu",,,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,,,,00207543,,IJPRB,,"English","Int J Prod Res",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035087514

Generally, the expected total distance travelled by stock pickers during an order consolidation and the resulting level of congestion experienced within aisle racking are common considerations when making these assignments. These criteria give rise to a bi-objective optimisation model with the aim of identifying multiple stock setups that achieve acceptable trade-offs between minimising the criteria on expectation. A mathematical framework is established in this paper, based on these two criteria, for evaluating the effectiveness of a given stock setup. In the framework, a stock picker’s movement between various storage locations is modelled as a Markov chain in order to quantify his or her expected travel distance, while a closed queuing network model is used to devise a suitable measure of congestion. This optimisation model framework forms the basis of a flexible decision support system (DSS) for the purpose of discovering high-quality stock assignment trade-off solutions for inventory managers. The DSS is applied to a special case study involving data from a real DC, and the desirability of the recommended stock configurations is compared with that currently implemented within the DC. © 2018, South African Institute of Industrial Engineering.

So-called ‘Fintech disruptors’ are aggressively tapping into their service delivery chain to offer clients a better (cheaper, more convenient or efficient) value proposition. As banks have subsequently been forced to think more strategically about how to conduct themselves due to the imminent use of, for example, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, biometrics and big data, regulators have simultaneously had to ensure that the pervasiveness of technological disruption does not threaten the soundness of banks and the stability of economies. Aim: To identify the strategic implications of Fintech on South African retail banks. Setting: The study is conducted in the South African retail banking industry. Methods: A post-positivist paradigm approach that is qualitative in nature. Results: There are several main findings: firstly, technology-based skills are becoming mandatory for staff and regulators alike; secondly, interaction policy is migrating clients towards a remote-based distribution strategy; thirdly, the bank of the future will not rely as heavily on brick-and-mortar branches as it has in the past; fourthly, new competitors are entering the fray and offer competitive digital-only solutions; finally, given the innovation and growth shown by these disruptors, financial sector regulators will have to find ways to hold them accountable. Conclusion: By adapting to the Fintech revolution, South African retail banks are hoping to become strategically pre-emptive rather than merely proactive. This will allow them not only to identify opportunities first, but also to offer solutions before competitors are able to do either of these. © 2018.

In this paper, we model a market comprised of a dominant entrant retailer, a weaker incumbent counterpart, and a common supplier from which both retailers source products. The retailers are quantity-competing, and the dominant retailer is entitled to determine the wholesale price it purchases, while the incumbent retailer accepts the price offered by the supplier. Besides, the incumbent retailer is assumed to hold private information about market demand. We investigate the collaboration strategy for the supplier which either cooperates with the dominant entrant retailer or with the vulnerable incumbent counterpart. Our result reveals that the supplier’s strategy depends on subtle considerations of multiple factors such as terminal market demand state, the demand fluctuation, the expected market demand and the dominant retailer’s wholesale price. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Dominant retailer; Game theory; Information concealment; Information leakage","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computation theory; Costs; Game theory; Demand fluctuations; Dominant retailers; Information concealment; Information leakage; Information strategy; Multiple factors; Private information; Whole sale prices; Sales",,,,,,,"Anand, K.S., Goyal, M., Strategic information management under leakage in a supply chain (2009) Manag.

The data sets acquired from SHM systems are undoubtedly of the “big data” type due to their sheer volume, complexity and diversity, and conducting relevant analyses of their content can help to identify damage or failure during operation through the relationships between the measurements taken by multiple sensors. A great deal can be learned from these large pools of data, resulting in significant advances in efficient integrity control. From banking to retail, many sectors have already embraced big data, which is often synonymous with “big expectations”; in the present case, it offers opportunities to apply data-processing research to the development of more efficient SHM systems with real-time capabilities. By presenting various examples of bridge monitoring systems, this paper contributes to the ongoing cross-disciplinary efforts in data science for the utilization and advancement of SHM. © 2018, Taylor and Francis Ltd..

In the software environment of the NAO robot, connected to the Internet with cloud services, we designed a social-like interaction where the robot carries out actions with the customer. In particular, we focused our design on two main skills the robot has to learn: the first is the ability to acquire social input communicated by relevant clues that humans provide about their emotional state (emotions, emotional speech), or collected in the Social Media (such as, information on the customer's tastes, cultural background, etc.). The second is the skill to express in turn its own emotional state, so that it can affect the customer buying decision, refining in the user the sense of interacting with a human-like companion. By combining social robotics and machine learning systems the potential of robotics to assist people in real life situations will increase, providing a gentle customers' acceptance of advanced technologies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Emotion and Gesture Recognition; Human Robot Interaction (HRI); Machine learning; Smart retail settings; Social robotics","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Machine design; Man machine systems; Robotics; Robots; Sales; Web services; Advanced technology; Cognitive architectures; Cultural backgrounds; Human robot Interaction (HRI); Retail settings; Shopping behavior; Social robotics; Software environments; Human robot interaction; emotion; gesture; human; human experiment; Internet; life; machine learning; robotics; shopping; skill; social media; software; speech",,,,,,,"http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/∼deluca/rob1_en/2016_WorldRobotics_ExecSummary_Service.pdf, (2016) Executive Summary World Robotics 2016-Service Robots.

In case of high-end priced products, the demand is seasonal and sensitive. The investment involves high risk and revenues vary beyond fathomable bounds. The primary objective of this research is to present a decision-support system for retail pricing and revenue optimization of these retail products. The sales data of past 2.5 years from prominent retail stores across 45 different regions has been used to develop this study. A regression tree/random forest-based machine learning algorithm is used to predict weekly demand. It incorporates price, holidays, discounts, inventory and other regional factors in decision making. Following this, the demand-price interdependencies are quantified and integrated into an integer linear programming model for optimal price allocation. This methodology has been implemented on offline retailing of expensive products which generally follow high variation in demand. The expected revenue has been optimized by branch & bound and branch & cut method, followed by root node analysis. The solution is further optimized by heuristic methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Analytics; Assignment; Branch and bound; Data mining; Integer programming; Retailing","Artificial intelligence; Costs; Data mining; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economics; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Retail stores; Sales; Analytics; Assignment; Demand prediction; Expensive products; Integer linear programming models; Primary objective; Retailing; Revenue optimization; Branch and bound method",,,,,"Shandong University, SDU

With current trends towards big Data Warehouses (DWs), it is attractive to run existing business intelligence/data warehousing applications on higher volumes of data in wide-column NoSQL databases for low latency by mapping multidimensional models to wide-column NoSQL models or using additional SQL add-ons. For examples, applications like retail management can run over integrated data sets stored in big DWs or in the cloud to capture current item-selling trends. Many of these systems also employ Snapshot Isolation (SI) as a concurrency control mechanism to achieve high throughput for read-heavy workloads. SI works well in a DW environment, as analytical queries can now work on (consistent) snapshots and are not impacted by concurrent update jobs performed by online incremental Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) flows that refresh fact/dimension tables. However, the snapshot made available in the DW is often stale, since at the moment when an analytical query is issued, the source updates (e.g. in a remote retail store) may not have been extracted and processed by the ETL process in time due to high input data volume or slow processing speed. This staleness may cause incorrect results for time-critical decision support queries. To address this problem, snapshots which are supposed to be accessed by analytical queries need to be first maintained by corresponding ETL flows to reflect source updates based on given freshness needs. Snapshot maintenance in this work means maintaining the distributed data partitions that are required by a query. Since most NoSQL databases are not ACID compliant and do not provide full-fledged distributed transaction support, snapshot may be inconsistently derived when its data partitions are updated by different ETL maintenance jobs. This paper describes an extended version of HBelt system [1] which tightly integrates the wide-column NoSQL database HBase with a clustered & pipelined ETL engine. Our objective is to efficiently refresh HBase tables with remote source updates while a consistent snapshot is guaranteed across distributed partitions for each scan request in analytical queries. A consistency model is defined and implemented to address so-called distributed snapshot maintenance. To achieve this, ETL jobs and analytical queries are scheduled in a distributed processing environment. In addition, a partitioned, incremental ETL pipeline is introduced to increase the performance of ETL (update) jobs. We validate the efficiency gain in terms of data pipelining and data partitioning using the TPC-DS benchmark, which simulates a modern decision support system for a retail product supplier. Experimental results show that high query throughput can be achieved in HBelt when distributed, refreshed snapshots are demanded. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed snapshot maintenance; Incremental ETL pipeline","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Concurrency control; Costs; Data handling; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Maintenance; Pipelines; Query processing; Retail stores; Sales; Analytical queries; Decision support query; Distributed processing; Distributed snapshots; Distributed transaction; Extract transform loads; Multi-dimensional model; Snapshot isolation; Distributed database systems",,,,,,,"Qu, W., Shankar, S., Ganza, S., Dessloch, S., Hbelt:integrating an incremental etl pipeline with a big data store for real-time analytics (2015) Advances in Databases and Information Systems, pp. 123-137. , Springer; Cattell, R., Scalable sql and nosql data stores (2011) ACM Sigmod.

As a result, most companies have increasingly been choosing the application of performance measurement systems. This significantly results in poor performance measurement regarding future business lagging measure. To solve this problem, this research presents a hybrid predictive performance measurement system (PPMS) using the neuro-fuzzy approach based on particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO). It is constructed from many leading aspects of convenience store performance measures and projects the competitive level of future business lagging measure. To do so, monthly store performance measures were first congregated from the case study value chains. Second, data cleaning and preparations by headquarter accounting verification were carried out before the proposed model construction. Third, these results were used as the learning dataset to derive a predictive performance measurement system based on ANFIS-PSO. The fuzzy value of each leading input was optimized by parallel processing PSO, before feeding to the neuro-fuzzy system. Finally, the model provides a future performance for the next month’s sales and expense to managers who focused on managing a store using desirability function (Di). It boosted the sales growth in 2012 by ten percentages using single PPMS. Additionally, the composite PPMS was also boosted by the same growth rate for the store in the blind test (July 2013–February 2014). From the experimental results, it can be concluded that ANFIS-PSO delivers high-accuracy modeling, delivering much smaller error and computational time compared to artificial neural network model and supports vector regression but its component searching time differs significantly because of the complexity of each model. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Neuro-fuzzy; Predictive performance measurement system; Retailing value chain; Swarm intelligence","Artificial intelligence; Chains; Deep neural networks; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sales; Supply chain management; Swarm intelligence; Artificial neural network modeling; Desirability function; Neuro-Fuzzy; Neuro-fuzzy approach; Parallel processing; Performance measurement system; Predictive performance; Value chains; Fuzzy inference",,,,,"Thailand Research Fund, TRF: PHD/0090/2553

Data mining contributes towards this and finds its application across various diverse domains such as in information technology, retail, stock markets, banking and healthcare among others. The surge in population together with the growth in diseases has obliged the insertion of data mining in medical diagnosis to pull out the underlying hidden pattern. Of these, asthma is a disease of high prevalence among children. Asthma prevalence increased from 2001 to 2010 and is now at its highest level. Asthma prevalence was higher among females, children and those with family income below the poverty level. It may be difficult to tell whether your child’s symptoms are caused by asthma or something else. Asthma, a disease which is extremely reliant on historical data for early diagnosis, has inclined researchers to follow the data mining techniques for the pre-diagnosis procedure. Existing medical techniques like X-Ray, Spirometer, impulse oscillometry and other lung examination techniques not only require complex equipment and high cost but are also proven to be efficient only when the child is more than 5 years old. The proposed system involves in developing a data mining model that will aid in the grouping of patients into the set that could hypothetically test positive for asthma. Depending on the results obtained as part of pre-diagnosis process from the tool, the doctor can perform the diagnosis for the confirmation of asthma in the patient and initiate the treatment at an early stage. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

Therefore, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is one of the important issue for the retail stores. It can be difficult to predict customers future behavior with the simple quantitive information such as purchase frequency since each customers are widely diversified. Although the company can obtain the variety of customers information from their online activity, the use of access history is still limited. In this paper, we defined “the variety of user access patterns” collected from their web browsing history and it shows the patterns they visit the website. Finally, we verified its effectiveness with developing a DNN model to predict customers future behavior. © 2017, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

Online reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and marketing strategies employed by vendors in e-commerce. However, the vast amount of reviews makes it difficult for the customers to mine sentiments from online reviews. To address this problem, sentiment mining system is needed to organize the online reviews automatically into different sentiment orientation categories (e.g. positive/negative). Due to the imbalanced nature of positive and negative sentiments, the real time sentiment mining is a challenging machine learning task. The main objective of this research work is to investigate the combined effect of machine learning classifiers and sampling methods in sentiment classification under imbalanced data distributions. A modification is proposed in support vector machine based ensemble algorithm which incorporates both oversampling and undersampling to improve the prediction performance. Extensive experimental comparisons are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method with several other classifiers used in terms of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the area under the ROC curve and geometric mean. © 2016","Ensemble;

Many hidden factors contribute to these two subjects, which refer to the different kinds of operators (as fundamentalist and behaviourist), the different objectives amongst the retails, the institutional and business operators, the different time ranges and the different allocation plans. Moreover, the news effects on shortest time range, the induced sentiment and market movers play a key role in the modelling of the financial market. Two decision variables, named Energy E and Entropy S are introduced. Some specific values of these two variables act as attractors in the state space E-S; conesequently these two variables are useful for describing the price dynamics during the different market status (i.e. up trend, down trend, accumulation, and distribution). The result is a new decision framework, where the investor, the trader and the analyst may perform their prospects and forecasts. A multiparametric methodology for financial trading, investment and prospects analysis is defined and introduced, by following the Prospect Theory and by assuming the price fluctuations as a dynamical process in the stochastic context. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Computational intelligence; Decision support system; Fuzzification and fuzzy sets; Inference for price dynamics; Information fusion; Multi parametric intelligence","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision support systems; Dynamics; Economics; Finance; Financial markets; Information fusion; Stochastic systems; Decision framework; Decision variables; Dynamical process; Financial trading; Fuzzifications; Multi parametric intelligence; Price dynamics; Price fluctuation; Investments",,,,,,,"Adya, M., Collopy, F., How effective are neural networks at forecasting and prediction? a review and evaluation (1998) J.

The authors demonstrate the success of machine learning techniques for gender classification. High-sensitivity accelerometers mounted noninvasively beneath an actual building floor provide the input for these machine learning methods. While other approaches using gait measurements, such as vision systems and wearable sensors, provide the potential for gender classification, they each face limitations. These limitations include an invasion of privacy, occupant compliance, required line of sight, and/or high sensor density. Underfloor mounted accelerometers overcome these limitations. The authors utilize the highly-instrumented Goodwin Hall smart building on the Virginia Tech campus to measure vibrations of the walking surface caused by walkers. In this paper, the gait of 15 individual walkers was recorded as they, alone, walked down the instrumented hallway. Fourteen accelerometers, mounted underneath the walking surface, recorded walking trials with the placement of the sensors unknown to the walker. This paper studies bagged decision trees, boosted decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks as the machine learning techniques for their ability to classify gender. A tenfold-cross-validation method is used to comment on the validity of the algorithm's ability to generalize to new walkers. This paper demonstrates that a gender classification accuracy of 88% is achievable using the underfloor vibration data from the Virginia Tech Goodwin Hall by using decision tree approaches. © 2014 IEEE.","Application platform; gait measurement; Goodwin Hall; smart buildings; vibration","Accelerometers; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Decision trees; Intelligent buildings; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sales; Social sciences; Trees (mathematics); Walking aids; Accelerometer measurement; Application platforms; Cross-validation methods; Gait measurements; Goodwin Hall; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; vibration; Wearable sensors",,,,,,,"Chiang, M., Low, S.H., Calderbank, A.R., Doyle, J.C., Layering as optimization decomposition: A mathematical theory of network architectures (2007) Proc IEEE, 95 (1), pp. 255-312. , Jan; Bonomi, F., Milito, R., Natarajan, P., Zhu, J., Fog computing: A platform for Internet of Things and analytics (2014) Big Data and Internet of Things: A Roadmap for Smart Environments, pp. 169-186. , Cham, Switzerland Springer Mar; Satyanarayanan, M., Bahl, P., Caceres, R., Davies, N., The case for VM-based cloudlets in mobile computing (2009) IEEE Pervasive Comput, 8 (4), pp. 14-23. , Oct./Dec; Chakraborty, A., Navda, V., Padmanabhan, V.N., Ramjee, R., Coordinating cellular background transfers using loadsense (2013) Proc.

Customer segmentation is an important technique for a marketing campaign to target the right customers. Most previous clustering algorithms have drawbacks, such as being stuck at local minima. To overcome such drawbacks this study attempts to develop a consumer segmentation model using a swarm intelligence based algorithm, called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The swarm intelligent algorithm has the advantage of using fewer parameters to reach a global optimal solution. In general, the value of customer segmentation is judged by the customer’s lifetime value. Based on many previous researches, the RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) model is the most well-known model used to compute customer lifetime value. This study calculates the RFM model from a data set into value-based information. Based on this value-based information the PSO algorithm is able to cluster consumers to find customers likely to be the most profitable and valuable. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PSO, we present an empirical case study involving a retail automobile marketing campaign. We compare the performance of the PSO customer segmentation algorithm against that of other segmentation algorithms (K-mean and self-organizing map (SOM)) and hybrid algorithms. The study finds the hybrid S-KMeans -PSO (SOM, K-Means and PSO) algorithms can reach the best performance. Finally, this study proposes effective marketing strategies for two segmented profitable and valuable customers. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Customer segmentation; Marketing campaign; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Conformal mapping; Evolutionary algorithms; Marketing; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Sales; Self organizing maps; Automobile marketings; Customer life time value; Customer segmentation; Empirical case studies; Global optimal solutions; Marketing campaign; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Segmentation algorithms; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,,"Bai, Q., Analysis of particle swarm optimization algorithm (2010) Comput Inf Sci, 3 (1), pp. 180-184; Berger, J.T., Peeling the customer loyalty onion (2006) Wiglaf J, , http://www.wiglafjournal.com; Chan, C.C.H., Online auction customer segmentation using a neural network model (2005) Int J Appl Sci Eng, 3 (2), pp. 101-109; Chan, C.C.H., Intelligent value-based customer segmentation method for campaign management: a case study of automobile retailer (2008) Expert Syst Appl, 34 (4), pp. 2754-2762; Chen, C.-Y., Ye, F., Particle swarm optimization algorithm and its application to clustering analysis (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Networking, sensing and Control Taipei, Taiwan, March, 21-23, pp. 789-794; Davies, D.L., Bouldin, D.W., A cluster separation measure (1979) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, PAMI-1, 2, pp. 224-227; Hsieh, N.C., An integrated data mining and behavioral scoring model for analyzing bank customers (2004) Expert Syst Appl, 27, pp. 623-633; Hu, T.L., Sheu, J.B., A fuzzy-based customer classification method for demand-responsive logistical distribution operations (2003) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 139, pp. 431-450; Hwang, H., Jung, T., Suh, E., A LTV model and customer segmentation based on customer value: a case study on the wireless telecommunication industry (2004) Expert Syst Appl, 26, pp. 181-188; Jang, J.S.R., Sun, C.T., Mizutani, E., (1997) Neuro-fuzzy and soft computing, , Prentice Hall Inc, USA; Jiao, J., Zhang, Y., Product portfolio identification based on association rule mining (2005) Comput Aided Des, 37, pp. 149-172; Jonker, J.J., Piersma, N., Poel, D., Joint optimization of customer segmentation and marketing policy to maximize long-term profitability (2004) Expert Syst Appl, 27, pp. 159-168; Kao, Y.T., Zahara, E., A hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization for multimodal functions (2008) Appl Soft Comput, 8, pp. 849-857; Kennedy, J., Eberhart, R., Particle swarm optimization (1995) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks, 4, pp. 1942-1948; Kim, Y.S., Street, W.N., An intelligent system for customer targeting: a data mining approach (2004) Decis Support Syst, 37, pp. 215-228; Kim, J., Wei, S., Ruys, H., Segmenting the market of West Australian senior tourists using an artificial neural network (2003) Tour Manag, 21 (4), pp. 25-34; Kim, Y.S., Street, W.N., Russell, G.J., Menczer, F., Customer targeting: a neural network approach guided by genetic algorithms (2005) Manage Sci, 51 (2), pp. 264-276; Kuo, R.J., An, Y.L., Wang, H.S., Chung, W.J., Integration of self-organizing feature maps neural network and genetic K-means algorithm for market segmentation (2006) Expert Syst Appl, 30, pp. 313-324; Pang, W., Wang, K.P., Zhou, C.G., Dong, L.J., Fuzzy discrete particle swarm optimization for solving traveling salesman problem.

To assist them, we develop an approach based on two artificial intelligence techniques to facilitate well-designed shelf space management. We propose an iterative simulation-optimization approach that integrates customers' shopping path in the potential demand and introduces it by simulation in the optimization. A profit-based integer programming is also presented that the related computer program, being able to solve small-sized instances, applies important factors including shelf level utility, attraction of store' zones, allocated shelf space, number of product facings, and demand substitution effects. The problem is inherently a complex and large-sized problem; therefore, we develop two algorithms: GA and hybrid GA with imperialist competitive algorithm.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the maximum gross profit and to analyze transition of waste costs and losses of purchasing opportunities in a retail store. We have developed a model of a retail store which performs simple three types of demand estimation and three types of ordering, and also created a model of customers which reflects consumer reactions to out-of-shelf situations such as brand switches and cancel purchasing by using actual Pointof- Sales and stock data. As a result of experiments by agent-based simulation, we obtained the order quantity to maximize the gross profit when the retail store made quantitative ordering. Moreover, we found that providing thresholds in minimum order amount increased gross profit and reduced losses of shortage. Finally, the combination of the demand estimation by using exponential smoothing and the threshold ordering made better performance than any other method. © 2016, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

Such applications include sales forecasting in retail stores, energy demand prediction of buildings for smart city, parts demand prediction to optimize inventory, and so on. This paper extends FAB/HME for classification and conducts the following two essential improvements. First, we derive a refined version of factorized information criterion which offers a better approximation of Bayesian marginal log-likelihood. Second, we introduce an analytic quadratic lower bounding technique in an EM-like iterative optimization process of FAB/HME, which drastically reduces computational cost.

In addition to providing map, navigation, and directory information, such services provide third-party applications with a technology framework including geospatial-visualization capabilities. For instance, consumers often use location-based services and spatial decision support systems (SDSS) to locate the nearest restaurants, search for ideal homes, navigate specific routes, and effectively participate in car and bike sharing programs. Organizations utilize SDSS to perform retail site selection, manage global assets, and optimize supply chains. While geospatial-visualization is a vital capability of online mapping services, little is understood about how it impacts the acceptance of technology. Through a partial least squares analysis of 577 subject responses, this paper demonstrates that the user-acceptance of geospatial-visualization is influenced by utilitarian, hedonic, and cognitive measures. This paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results to research and practice.","Geospatial-visualization; Online mapping services; Spatial decision support systems; Technology acceptance model","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Least squares approximations; Mapping; Online systems; Site selection; Supply chains; Telecommunication services; Visualization; Acceptance of technologies; Directory information; Geospatial visualization; Online mapping; Partial least squares analysis; Spatial decision support systems; Technology acceptance model; Third party application (Apps); Location based services",,,,,,,"Abad, M., Díaz, I., Vigo, M., Acceptance of mobile technology in hedonic scenarios (2010) Proceedings of the 24th BCS Interactive Specialist Group Conference, pp. 250-258; Ajzen, I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior (1985) Action-control: From Cognition to Behavior, pp. 11-39. , Kuhl J, Beckmann J New-York: Springer-Verlag; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Al-Momani, K., Noor, N.A.M., E-service quality, ease of use, usability and enjoyment as antecedents of E-CRM performance: An empirical investigation in Jordan mobile phone services (2009) Asian J Technol Manage, 2, pp. 50-63; Amoako-Gyampah, K., Perceived usefulness, user involvement and behavioral intention: An empirical study of ERP implementation (2007) Comput Hum Behav., 23, pp. 1232-1248; Amoako-Gyampah, K., Salam, A.F., An extension of the technology acceptance model in an ERP implementation environment (2004) Inf Manage, 41, pp. 731-745; Anderson, C.L., Agarwal, R., Practicing safe computing: A multimethod empirical examination of home computer user security behavioral intentions (2010) MIS Q., 34, pp. 613-643; Arning, K., Ziefle, M., Barriers of information access in small screen device applications: The relevance of user characteristics for a transgenerational design (2007) Universal Access in Ambient Intell Environ, 4397, pp. 117-136. , Stephanidis, C., Piper, M.

One recent technique to alleviate such conditions is to introduce a mobile food retailer within the community but preliminary evidence raises concerns regarding this retail format. While extensive literature exists regarding other alleviation strategies, research on mobile food retailers has been sparse. To facilitate new research into the efficacy and deployment of mobile food retailers, operations research tools are outlined and discussed. These tools specifically address the product mix and the routing plan of the retailer as these decisions represent the greatest barriers to success for current retailers. A set of potential tools is developed and employed within a preliminary case study in a Phoenix, Arizona community and the results demonstrate the utility of the methodology by identifying changes to both the product mix and routing plan which could result in greater earnings potential. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It determines the number and the locations of these supermarkets to minimize transportation and inventory fixed costs of the system. Design/methodology/approach - This is done using integer programming model and real genetic algorithm (RGA) in which custom chromosomes representation, two custom mating and two custom mutation operators were proposed. Findings - The performance of RGA is very good since it gives results that are very close or identical to the optimal ones in reasonable CPU time. Research limitations/implications - The study is applicable only if a group of supermarkets feed the same assembly line. Originality/value - For the first time in supermarket location problem, limitation on availability of some areas for possible supermarkets' locations and capacity of the supermarkets were taken into consideration. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; In-plant milk run; Mixed model assembly line; Supermarket","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Assembly; Assembly machines; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Assembly line; Design/methodology/approach; Integer programming models; Location problems; Mixed-model assembly lines; Mutation operators; Supermarket; Supermarket locations; Retail stores",,,,,,,"Battini, D., Boysen, N., Emde, S., Just-in-Time supermarkets for part supply in the automobile industry (2013) Journal of Management Control, 24 (2), pp. 209-217; Battini, D., Faccio, M., Persona, A., Sgarbossa, F., Framework to optimise the inventory centralisation/decentralisation degree and feeding policy in assembly systems (2010) International Journal of Services and Operations Management, 6 (2), pp. 184-205; Battini, D., Faccio, M., Persona, A., Sgarbossa, F., Supermarket warehouses: Stocking policies optimization in an assembly-to-order environment (2010) International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 50 (5-8), pp. 775-788; Baudin, M., (2004) Lean Logistics: The Nuts and Bolts of Delivering Materials and Goods, , Productivity Press, New York, NY; Bozer, Y., Ciemnoczolowski, D., Performance evaluation of small-batch container delivery systems used in lean manufacturing-part 1: System stability and distribution of container starts (2013) International Journal of Production Research, 51 (2), pp. 555-567; Emde, S., Boysen, N., Optimally routing and scheduling tow trains for JIT supply of mixed-model assembly lines (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 217 (2), pp. 287-299; Emde, S., Boysen, N., Optimally locating in-house logistics areas to facilitate JIT-supply of mixed-model assembly lines (2012) International Journal of Production Economics, 135 (1), pp. 393-402; Emde, S., Fliedner, M., Boysen, N., Optimally loading tow trains for JIT-supply of mixed-model assembly lines (2012) IIE Transactions, 44 (2), pp. 121-135; Faccio, M., Gamberi, M., Persona, A., Kanban number optimization in a supermarket warehouse feeding a mixed-model assembly system (2013) International Journal of Production Research, 51 (10), pp. 2997-3017; Haupt, R.L., Haupt, S.E., (2004) Practical Genetic Algorithms, 2nd Ed, , John Wiley & Sons, NJ; Melo, M.T., Nickel, S., Saldanha-Da-Gama, F., Facility location and supply chain management - A review (2009) European Journal of Operational Research, 196 (2), pp. 401-412; Reijmers, T.H., Wehrens, R., Buydens, L.M., Quality criteria of genetic algorithms for construction of phylogenetic trees (1999) Journal of Computational Chemistry, 20 (8), pp. 867-876; Wanke, P.F., Zinn, W., Strategic logistics decision making (2004) International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 34 (6), pp. 466-478; Yano, C.A., Bozer, Y., Kamoun, M., Optimizing dock configuration and staffing in decentralized receiving (1998) IIE Transactions, 30 (7), pp. 657-668","Alnahhal, M.; Transport Systems and Logistics, Duisburg-Essen UniversityGermany",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,01445154,,ASAUD,,"English","Assem.

This study extracts criteria used by food safety experts in determining bacterial persistence in the environment, using retail delicatessen operations as a model. Using the Delphi method, we conducted an expert elicitation with 10 food safety experts from academia, industry, and government to classify L. monocytogenes persistence based on environmental sampling results collected over six months for 30 retail delicatessen stores. The results were modeled using variations of random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, and linear regression; variable importance values of random forest and support vector machine models were consolidated to rank important variables in the experts' classifications. The duration of subtype isolation ranked most important across all expert categories. Sampling site category also ranked high in importance and validation errors doubled when this covariate was removed. Support vector machine and random forest models successfully classified the data with average validation errors of 3.1% and 2.2% (n = 144), respectively. Our findings indicate that (i) the frequency of isolations over time and sampling site information are critical factors for experts determining subtype persistence, (ii) food safety experts from different sectors may not use the same criteria in determining persistence, and (iii) machine learning models have potential for future use in environmental surveillance and risk management programs. Future work is necessary to validate the accuracy of expert and machine classification against biological measurement of L. monocytogenes persistence. © 2014 Society for Risk Analysis.","Bacterial persistence;

The collected audience measurement data can be used as a unique basis for statistical analysis of viewing patterns, interactive display applications and also for further research and observer modelling. Here, we use machine learning methods on real-world digital signage viewership data to predict consumer behaviour in a retail environment, especially oriented towards the purchase decision process and the roles in purchasing situations. A case study is performed on data from a small retail shop where demographic and audience data of 1294 store customers were collected, manually verified and analysed. Among all customers, 246 store customers were involved in a buying process that resulted in an actual purchase. Comparison of different machine learning methods shows that by using support vector machines we can predict with 88.6% classification accuracy whether a customer will actually make a purchase, which outperforms classification accuracy of a baseline (majority) classifier by 7.5%. A similar approach can also be used to predict the roles of an individual in the purchase decision process. We show that by extending the audience measurement dataset with additional heuristic features, the support vector machines classifier on average improves the classification accuracy of a baseline classifier by 15%. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"Artificial intelligence; Broadcasting; Classification (of information); Consumer behavior; Forecasting; Learning systems; Population statistics; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; Emerging technologies; Interactive display; Machine learning methods; Measurement data; Public broadcasting; Purchase decision; Temporal features; Sales",,,,,,,"Lundstrőm, L.I., (2008) Digital Signage Broadcasting: Content Management and Distribution Techniques.

As a result, modern Web development infrastructure must be able to process large numbers of events (e.g., for location-based features) and support analytics over those events, with applications ranging from banking (e.g., fraud detection) to retail (e.g., just-in-time personalized promotions). We describe a system specifically designed for those applications, allowing high-throughput event processing along with analytics. Our main contribution is the design and implementation of an in-memory JSON store that can handle both events and analytics workloads. The store relies on the JSON model in order to serve data through a common Web API. Thanks to the flexibility of the JSON model, the store can integrate data from systems of record (e.g., customer profiles) with data transmitted between the server and a large number of clients (e.g., locationbased events or transactions). The proposed store is built over a distributed, transactional, in-memory object cache for performance. Our experiments show that our implementation handles high throughput and low latency without sacrificing scalability. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Analytics; Events Processing; In-Memory Database; JSON; Rules","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Analytics; Customer profiles; Design and implementations; Event Processing; JSON; Memory database; Rules; Web development; Cache memory",,,,,,,"Abadi, D.J., Ahmad, Y., The design of the Borealis stream processing engine (2005) Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR), pp. 277-289; Alvaro, P., Condie, T., Conway, N., Elmeleegy, K., Hellerstein, J.M., Sears, R., BOOM analytics: Exploring data-centric, declarative programming for the cloud (2010) European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys), pp. 223-236; Anderson, J.C., Lehnardt, J., Slater, N., CouchDB: The definitive guide (2010) O’Reilly; A.J.:Workflow, transactions and Datalog (1999) Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS), pp. 294-305. , Bonner; Brenna, L., Gehrke, J., Johansen, D., Hong, M., Distributed event stream processing with non-deterministic finite automata (2009) Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems (DEBS); Ceri, S., Widom, J., Production rules in parallel and distributed database environments (1992) Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB), pp. 339-351; Chang, F., Dean, J., Ghemawat, S., Hsieh, W.C., Wallach, D.A., Burrows, M., Chandra, T., Gruber, R.E., Bigtable: A distributed storage system for structured data (2006) Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI), pp. 205-218; Cooper, B.F., Silberstein, A., Benchmarking cloud serving systems with YCSB (2010) Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC), pp. 143-154; Florescu, D., Fourny, G., JSONiq: The history of a query language (2013) IEEE Internet Computing, 17 (5), pp. 86-90; Forgy, C.L., OPS5 user’s manual.

In this paper, we propose a new systems architecture that combines the textual content in social media messages with product information, such as the descriptions summarized in catalogs, in order to provide marketing campaign recommendations. Companies commonly build user profiles based on purchase histories and other customer-specific information; however, when dealing with social media, we often cannot match the social media users with the customers. In this regard, we address the problem of targeting individual social media messages for which no personalized profile information can be retrieved. Our solution combines two disparate computational toolboxes for text analytics - natural language processing and machine learning - in order to select social media users for whom to target with topic-specific advertisements. Natural language processing is used to analyze the context of social media messages, and machine learning is used to analyze product information, with the goal being to match social media messages to products and ranking potential advertisements. To demonstrate the framework, we detail a real-world application in the travel and tourism industry using Twitter® as the social media platform. © 1957-2012 IBM.",,"Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Public relations; Sales; Customer relationships; Marketing campaign; NAtural language processing; Product information; Social media platforms; Specific information; Systems architecture; Travel and tourism; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,"Larsen, J.B., (2013) Content-based Recommender Systems, , M.S. thesis, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark; Mooney, R.J., Roy, L., Content-based book recommending using learning for text categorization (1999) Proc.

This algorithm is based on the following basic hypothesis: the high-dimensional input feature space can be preliminarily restricted to only the important features. In this preliminary restriction, fast algorithms for feature ranking and earlier experience are used. Additionally, enhancements are made in the creation of the initial population, as well as by introducing an incremental stage in the genetic algorithm. The performances of the proposed HGA-NN classifier are evaluated using a real-world credit dataset that is collected at a Croatian bank, and the findings are further validated on another real-world credit dataset that is selected in a UCI database. The classification accuracy is compared with that presented in the literature. Experimental results that were achieved using the proposed novel HGA-NN classifier are promising for feature selection and classification in retail credit risk assessment and indicate that the HGA-NN classifier is a promising addition to existing data mining techniques. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach–The research makes an attempt to capture the knowledge of segmenting the customers based on various attributes as an input to the demand forecasting in a retail store. The paper suggests a data mining model which has been used for forecasting of demand. The proposed model has been applied for forecasting demands of eight SKUs for grocery items in a supermarket. Based on the proposed forecasting model, the inventory performance has been studied with simulation. Findings–The proposed forecasting model with the inventory replenishment system results in the reduction of inventory level and increase in customer service level. Hence, the proposed model in the paper results in improved performance of inventory. Practical implicationsRetailers can make use of the proposed model for demand forecasting of various items to improve the inventory performance and profitability of operations. Originality/value–With the advent of data mining systems which have given rise to the use of business intelligence in various domains, the current paper addresses one of the most pressing issues in retail management, as demand forecasting with minimum error is the key to success in inventory and supply chain management. The proposed forecasting model with the inventory replenishment system results in the reduction of inventory level and increase in customer service level. The proposed model outperforms other widely used existing models. © 2012, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Demand forecasting; Inventory management; Logistics; Operations management; Supermarkets; Supply chain management",,,,,,,,"Aburto, L., Weber, R., Improved supply chain management based on hybrid demand forecasts (2007) Applied Soft Computing, 7 (1), pp. 136-144. , ()“”-; Agrawal, D., Schorling, C., Market share forecasting: an empirical comparison of artificial neural networks and multinomial logit model (1996) Journal of Retailing, 72 (4), pp. 383-407. , ()“”-; Bala, P.K., A data mining model for investigating the impact of promotion in retailing (2009) Proceedings of IEEE International Advance Computing Conference, Patiala, India, March 6-7, pp. 670-674. , ()“”-; Bala, P.K., Data mining for retail inventory management (2009) Advances in Electrical Engineering and Computational Science, 39, pp. 587-598. , AoS.I.GelmanL.()“”in(Eds)LNEE Series-SpringerNew YorkNY:; Bala, P.K., Sural, S., Banerjee, R.N., Association rule for purchase dependence in multi-item inventory (2010) Production Planning & Control, 21 (3), pp. 274-285. , ()“”-; Barksdale, H.C., Hilliard, J.E., A cross-spectral analysis of retail inventories and sales (1975) Journal of Business, 48 (3), pp. 365-382. , ()“”-; Bowerman, B.L., O'Connell, R.T., (1993) Forecasting and Time Series: An Applied Approach, , ()3rd ed.Duxbury PressBelmontCA:; Chang, C.W., Lin, C.T., Wang, L.Q., Mining the text information to optimizing the customer relationship management (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (2), pp. 1433-1443. , ()“”-(Part-1); Fildes, R., Goodwin, P., Lawrence, M., Nikolopoulos, K., Effective forecasting and judgmental adjustments: an empirical evaluation and strategies for improvement in supply-chain planning (2009) International Journal of Forecasting, 25 (1), pp. 3-23. , ()“”-; Huarng, K.&.#.0.0.2.D.;.H., Yu, T.H.K., The application of neural networks to forecast fuzzy time series (2006) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 363 (2), pp. 481-491. , ()“”-; Huarng, K.&.#.0.0.2.D.;.H., Yu, T.H.K., Kao, T.&.#.0.0.2.D.;.T., Analyzing structural changes using clustering techniques (2008) International Journal of Innovative Computing Information and Control, 4 (5), pp. 1195-1201. , ()“”-; Huarng, K.&.#.0.0.2.D.;.H., Yu, T.H.K., Sole Parellada, F., An innovative regime switching model to forecast Taiwan tourism demand (2011) The Service Industries Journal (Special Issue on Tourism Services), 31 (10), pp. 1603-1612. , ()“”-; McKenzie, E., General exponential smoothing and the equivalent ARIMA process (1984) Journal of Forecasting, 3 (3), pp. 333-444. , ()“”-; Moon, M.A., Mentzer, J.T., Smith, C.D., Conducting a sales forecasting audit (2003) International Journal of Forecasting, 19 (1), pp. 5-25. , ()“”-; Ngai, E.W.T., Xiu, L., Chau, D.C.K., Application of data mining techniques in customer relationship management: a literature review and classification (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36, pp. 2592-2602. , ()“” 2-(Part-2); Sun, Z., Bebis, G., Miller, R., Object detection using feature subset selection (2004) Pattern Recognition, 37, pp. 2165-2176. , ()“”-; Thall, N., Neural forecasts: a retail sales booster (1992) Discount Merchandiser, 23 (10), pp. 41-42. , ()“”-; Wong, W., Fu, A.W., Wang, K., Data mining for inventory item selection with cross-selling considerations (2005) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 11 (1), pp. 81-112. , ()“”-; Yan, L., Wolniewicz, R., Dodier, R., Predicting customer behaviour in telecommunications (2004) IEE Intelligent Systems, 19 (2), pp. 50-58. , ()“”-; Yu, T.H.K., Huarng, K.&.#.0.0.2.D.;.H., A bivariate fuzzy time series model to forecast the TAIEX (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 34 (4), pp. 2945-2952. , ()“”-; Yu, T.H.K., Huarng, K.&.#.0.0.2.D.;.H., A neural network-based fuzzy time series model to improve forecasting (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (4), pp. 3366-3372. , ()“”-; Yu, T.H.K., Huarng, K.&.#.0.0.2.D.;.H., Rianto, R., Neural network-based fuzzy auto-regressive models of different orders to forecast Taiwan stock index (2009) International Journal of Economics and Business Research, 1 (3), pp. 347-358. , ()“”-","Bala, P.K.; Xavier Institute of ManagementIndia; email: p_k_bala@rediffmail.com",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,17465664,,,,"English","J.

Categories are generated by a heterogeneous data fusion using an ID-POS data and customer's questionnaire responses with respect to their lifestyle. We propose a latent class model that is an extension of PLSI model. In the proposed model, customers and items are classified probabilistically into some latent lifestyle categories and latent item category. We show that the performance of the proposed model is superior to that of the k-means and PLSI in terms of category mining. We produce a Bayesian network model including the customer and item categories, situations and conditions of purchases. Based on that network structure, we can systematically identify useful knowledge for use in sustainable services. In the retail service, knowledge management with point of sales data mining is integral to maintaining and improving productivity. This method provides useful knowledge based on the ID-POS data for efficient customer relationship management and can be applicable for other service industries.

ACO simulates the decision-making processes of colonies of ants as they forage for food and is related to other artificial intelligence techniques such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms. Experimentation shows that ACO is successful in finding solutions near the best-known solutions for problems with up to 20 demand locations. In addition, testing for the affect of spatial patterns suggested by the logistics literature for facility locations appears to make a difference in the quality of the solutions for the two algorithms. Finally, ACO is shown to be superior to the savings algorithm found in software packages and as a result should be tested on even larger, more complex logistics-oriented vehicle routing problems, representative of those encountered in larger industrial and retail settings. 2010 Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals","Ant colony optimization; Heuristics; Logistics; Optimization; Swarm behavior; Vehicle routing",,,,,,,,"Abdinnour-Helm, S., Using Simulated Annealing to Solve the P-hub Median Problem (2001) International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 31 (3), pp. 203-220; Agarwal, Y.K., (1985) A Set Partitioning Approach to the Vehicle Routing Problem, , ” Unpublished Ph.D. Dissertation, Case-Western Reserve University; Albritton, M.D., McMullen, P.R., Optimal Product Design Using a Colony of Virtual Ants (2007) European Journal of Operational Research, 176 (1), pp. 498-520; Ballou, R.H., (2004) Business Logistics/Supply Chain Management, pp. 225-249. , 5th ed., New York, Pearson Prentice Hall; Ballou, R.H., A Continued Comparison of Several Popular Algorithms for Vehicle Routing and Scheduling (1990) Journal of Business Logistics, 11 (1), pp. 111-126; Ballou, R.H., Agarwal, Y.K., A Performance Comparison of Several Popular Algorithms for Vehicle Routing and Scheduling (1988) Journal of Business Logistics, 9 (1), pp. 51-65; Bauer, A., Bullnheimer, B., Hartl, R.F., Strauss, C., An Ant Colony Optimization Approach for the Single Machine Tool Tardiness Problem (1999) Proceedings of the 1999 Congress on Evolutionary Computation, pp. 1445-1450; Bautista, J., Pereira, J., Ant Algorithms for a Time and Space Constrained Assembly Line Balancing Problem (2007) European Journal of Operations Research, 177 (3), pp. 2016-2034; Bean, N., Costa, A., An Analytic Modeling Approach for Network Routing Algorithms that Use ‘Ant-like’ Mobile Agents (2005) Computer Networks, 45 (2), pp. 243-266; Bell, J.E., McMullen, P.R., An Ant Colony Optimization Approach to the Vehicle Routing Problem (2004) Advanced Engineering Informatics, 18 (1), pp. 41-48; Berry, L.M., Murtagh, B.A., McMahon, G.B., Sugden, S.J., Welling, L.D., Genetic Algorithms in the Design of Complex Distribution Networks (1998) International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 28 (5), pp. 377-381; Bland, J.A., Space Planning by Ant Colony Optimization (1999) International Journal of Computer Applications in Technology, 12 (6), pp. 320-328; Bonabeau, E., Meyer, C., Swarm Intelligence: A Whole New Way to Think about Business (2001) Harvard Business Review, 79 (5), pp. 106-114; Bullnheimer, B., Hartl, R.F., Strauss, C., Applying the Ant System to the Vehicle Routing Problem (1998) Meta-Heuristics: Advances and Trends in Local Search Paradigms for Optimization, pp. 109-120. , Stefan Voss, S.

In this case, the customer attribute refers to the gender of customers in retail outlets such as supermarkets, shopping malls and shopping centers. In Japan, many retailers are now facing problems of low productivity per unit selling area. The ability to recognize customer attributes enables retailers to target a specific customer class, which can improve responses to special sales promotions and lead to improved sales. At the place of measurement, such as the entrance or shopping aisles, the system can recognize the attributes of various customers in detail. The apparatus used in this study is a pressure sensor that has the advantage of not invading customer privacy. Customer gender is estimated by measuring foot size, foot shape, step and weight. From the obtained experimental results, we verified that the proposed system can recognize customer attributes. Our research can contribute to raising the productivity of a retail area using information technology.","Customer attribute; Marketing; Pressure sensor; Recognition system","Artificial intelligence technologies; Customer attribute; Customer privacy; Foot shape; Marketing information system; Per unit; Recognition systems; Retail outlets; Sales promotions; Shopping mall; Artificial intelligence; Customer satisfaction; Information technology; Pressure sensors; Productivity; Shopping centers; Sales",,,,,,,"(2007) Government of Japan: Basic Policies, , The Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy (CEFP), Cabinet Office, in Japanese; (2007) Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI-1): Announcement of ""Toward Accelerating IT-Based Productivity Improvement"" (IT Frontier Initiative), , provisional name; (2007) Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI-2): Announcement of Candidate Projects under the ""FY 2007 Survey Program to Support Service Industry Productivity Improvements, , in the Service Engineering R&D Sector and the Service Engineering Application Demonstration Sector""; (2007) Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI-3): Announcement of Candidate Projects under the ""FY2007 Survey Program to Support Service Industry Productivity Improvements, , in the Service Process Improvement Example Development Sector""; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT): The Third Science and Technology Basic Plan, , FY2006-2010 (2006) (in Japanese); (2007) Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT): Announcement of Successful Applicants for ""Human Resource Development Program for Service-Innovation"", , in Japanese; Yamaguchi, T., (2007) J.

Currently, most vendors have established various take-back systems in local retail shops. The integration of the recycling depots established by local authorities with these private facilities can significantly improve access for residents. As a response to this need, an integrated system capable of providing optimization analysis and geographical information system functions has been designed to assist local authorities in identifying the regions where supplementary recycling depots need to be located to improve access to. A customized program which allows online optimization analysis has been developed and embedded in an integrated system. Through a user-friendly interface, users can interactively locate the supplementary depots within the desired regions. The interactive process improves the flexibility of the integrated system and avoids the shortcomings of impractical locations for recycling depots. A case study of battery recycling in central Taiwan is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated system. By using the proposed integrated system to analyze the existing conditions, the locations of supplementary points to improve access to the existing regional recycling collection points can be determined. In short, the proposed methodology provides local authorities with an uncomplicated and streamlined system with which to determine the number and locations of supplementary recycling points. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The paper is sub-divided into two parts. The first part gives an overview over the different phases of information processing in the work domain. It starts by charting the past and present usage of computers in work environments and shows current technological trends, which are likely to influence future business applications. The second part starts by briefly describing, how the usage of computers changed business processes in the past, and presents first Ambient Intelligence applications based on identification and localization information, which are already used in the production and retail sector. Based on current systems and prototype applications, the paper gives an outlook of how Ambient Intelligence technologies could change business processes in the future.","Ambient intelligence; Business applications; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Ubiquitous computing","Ambient intelligence; Business applications; Business Process; Information and Communication Technologies; Information processing; Intelligent technology; Localization information; On currents; Past and present; Technological trends; Work domains; Work environments; Artificial intelligence; Data processing; Human computer interaction; Radio waves; Software prototyping; Ubiquitous computing; Information technology; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Radio frequency identification (RFID); Artificial intelligence",,,,,,,"Aarts, E., Harwig, R., Schuurmans, M., Ambient Intelligence (2002) The Invisible Future - the Seamless Integration of Technology In Everyday Life, pp. 235-250. , P.

In online purchase situations, the use of recommendation agents increases the value of product information as information becomes adaptive and thus more relevant to consumers' information needs. Correspondingly, mobile recommendation agents (MRAs) may also increase the value of product information in bricks-and-mortar stores. In this sense, product information is not only adaptive but can also be requested at any place such as in front of products consumers are interested in. Because unprecedented, we investigate the use of a MRA that is virtually bound to a physical product via an RFID-enabled mobile device and provides product information. Based on Theory of Planned Behavior, Innovation Diffusion Theory, and Technology Acceptance Model, we develop a model to better understand the impact of MRAs on usage intentions, product purchases and store preferences of consumers. This model is then tested in a lab experiment (n = 47). Among high usability scores, results indicate that perceived usefulness of a MRA influences product purchases, predicts usage intentions and store preferences of consumers. Thus, new business models for retail stores can be considered in which MRAs satisfy both the information needs of consumers and the communication needs of retailers. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The scheme uses error-correcting codes to overcome the noisiness inherent in biometric readings. Our iris template incorporates reliable region selection, reliable bit estimation and one-sided masking techniques that provide for both robust verification and large key sizes. An implementation and experiments with the University of Bath iris dataset indicate that our scheme provides for generation and recovery of 260-bit keys with an EER of 0%. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Under the stress of various forceful challenges, customer satisfaction and product loyalties form the necessary key for enterprises to survive or even thrive in this decade. The concept of Quality Management System (QMS) offers a chance for enterprises to win customer satisfaction by producing consistently high-quality products. With the use of Data Mining (DM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, enterprises are able to discover previously hidden yet useful knowledge from large and related databases which assists to support the high-valued continuous quality improvement. Continuous quality improvement is of utmost importance to enterprises as it helps turn them potent to compete in today's rivalrous global business market. In this chapter, Intelligent Quality Management System with the use of Fuzzy Association Rules is the main focus. Fuzzy Association Rule is a useful data mining technique which has received tremendous attention. Through integrating the fuzzy set concept, enterprises or users are able to decode the discovered rules and turn them into more meaningful and easily understandable knowledge, for instance, they can extract interesting and meaningful customer behavior pattern from a pile of retail data. In order to better illustrate how this technique is used to deal with the quantitative process data and relate process parameters with the quality of finished products, an example is provided as well to help explain the concept. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,,,,,,,"Ament, C., Goch, G., A learning fuzzy control approach to improve manufacturing quality (1999) IEEE, pp. 156-161. , September;

The VDS architecture supports the decision processes within retail stores by providing users with three main functionalities: Store layout analysis, item and shelf management, and store monitoring and control by real-time simulation (or remote control by on-line simulation). As additional functionality, not related to the decision process within a retail store, the VDS architecture could also be used as a virtual web shop for e-commerce. To provide evidence on the relevance of the VDS, the architecture is tested within a real store by proposing four different application examples that show the potential of the VDS as an advanced decision support system. © 2010, The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.

In this paper we describe the development of agent-based simulation models, designed to help to understand the relationship between people management practices and retail performance. We report on the current development of our simulation models which includes new features concerning the evolution of customers over time. To test the features we have conducted a series of experiments dealing with customer pool sizes, standard and noise reduction modes, and the spread of customers’ word of mouth. To validate and evaluate our model, we introduce new performance measure specific to retail operations. We show that by varying different parameters in our model we can simulate a range of customer experiences leading to significant differences in performance measures. Ultimately, we are interested in better understanding the impact of changes in staff behavior due to changes in store management practices. Our multi-disciplinary research team draws upon expertise from work psychologists and computer scientists. Despite the fact we are working within a relatively novel and complex domain, it is clear that intelligent agents offer potential for fostering sustainable organizational capabilities in the future. © 2010, The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.

This integrated system is composed by a Decision Support System (DSS) based on a Consumer Characterization Framework (CCF). The CCF is based on data mining techniques, applied to obtain useful knowledge about electricity consumers from large amounts of consumption data. This knowledge is acquired following an innovative and systematic approach able to identify different consumers' classes, represented by a load profile, and its characterization using decision trees. The framework generates inputs to use in the knowledge base and in the database of the DSS. The rule sets derived from the decision trees are integrated in the knowledge base of the DSS. The load profiles together with the information about contracts and electricity prices form the database of the DSS. This DSS is able to perform the classification of different consumers, present its load profile and test different electricity tariffs and contracts. The final outputs of the DSS are a comparative economic analysis between different contracts and advice about the most economic contract to each consumer class. The presentation of the DSS is completed with an application example using a real data base of consumers from the Portuguese distribution company. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press.

One of the key outputs of an internal rating system is the probability of default (PD), which reflects the likelihood that a counterparty will default on his/her financial obligation. Since the PD modelling problem basically boils down to a discrimination problem (defaulter or not), one may rely on the myriad of classification techniques that have been suggested in the literature. However, since the credit risk models will be subject to supervisory review and evaluation, they must be easy to understand and transparent. Hence, techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines are less suitable due to their black box nature. Building upon previous research, we will use AntMiner to build internal rating systems for credit risk. AntMiner allows to infer a propositional rule set from a given data set, hereby using the principles from Ant Colony Optimization. Experiments will be conducted using various types of credit data sets (retail, small- and medium-sized enterprises and banks). It will be shown that the extracted rule sets are both powerful in terms of discriminatory power and comprehensibility. Furthermore, a framework will be presented describing how AntMiner fits into a global Basel II credit risk management system. © 2010 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Principal components analysis is used for variable reduction purposes. Four standard credit scoring techniques- naïve Bayes, logistic regression, recursive partitioning and artificial neural network-are compared to SMO, using a sample of 195 healthy firms and 51 distressed firms over five time periods between 1994 and 2002. The five techniques perform well in predicting default particularly one year before financial distress. Furthermore, the prediction still remains sound even 5 years before default. No single methodology has the absolute best classification ability, as the model performance varies in terms of different time periods and variable groups. External influences have greater impacts on the naïve Bayes than other techniques. In terms of similarity with Moody's ranking, SMO excelled over other techniques in most of the time periods.

This paper describes the development of a Multi-Dimensional Data Organization (MDDO). OurMDDOstores a collection of knowledge of the same category classified by multiple orthogonal dimensions. Each dimension has a number of indices reflecting the potential attribute values of that dimension. A knowledge object is identified by a unique combination of indices from multiple dimensions whose values signify the different properties of the object itself. Our solution allows the collection of knowledge to be learned dynamically in any order and in an incremental manner. This MDDO has been used to store part of the English grammar, and we describe in this paper how it assists a learning program in both the parsing and the production of an English sentence. We also define the functionalities of the data organization, describe its organization, describe how each function is implemented, and analyze their worst-case performances. © 2009 - IOS Press and the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Data structure; Dynamic structure; Knowledge learning system; Natural language processing","Attribute values; Data organization; English sentences; Knowledge learning; Knowledge system; Learning programs; Multidimensional data; Multiple dimensions; NAtural language processing; Worst-case performance; Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Data structures; Formal languages; Retail stores; Natural language processing systems",,,,,,,"Böhm, C., Berchtold, S., Kriegel, H.P., Michel, U., Multidimensional Index Structures in Relational Databases (2000) Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 15 (1), pp. 51-70. , July-Aug; Cheng, K., (2000) An Object-Oriented Approach to Machine Learning, pp. 487-492. , Proc.

To this end, this paper develops a new model for electricity retail where end-use customers choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers. The model is based on simultaneous reverse combinatorial auctions, designed as a second-price sealed-bid multi-item auction with supply function bidding. This model prevents strategic bidding and allows the auctioneer to maximise its pay-off. Furthermore, we develop optimal single-item and multi-item algorithms for winner determination in such auctions that are significantly less complex than those currently available in the literature. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

However, the search for an ideal network structure is a complex task. Evolutionary computation is a promising global search approach for feature and model selection. In this paper, an evolutionary computation approach is proposed in searching for the ideal network structure for a forecasting system. Two years' apparel sales data are used in the analysis. The optimized neural networks structure for the forecasting of apparel sales is developed. The performances of the models are compared with the basic fully connected neural networks and the traditional forecasting models. We find that the proposed algorithms are useful for fashion retail forecasting, and the performance of it is better than the traditional SARIMA model for products with features of low demand uncertainty and weak seasonal trends. It is applicable for fashion retailers to produce short-term retail forecasting for apparels, which share these features. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The study focuses on the US retail market. Four standard credit scoring methodologies: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Recursive Partitioning and Artificial Neural Network, are compared with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), using a sample of 195 healthy companies and 51 distressed firms over five time periods from 1994 to 2002. The five methodologies performed well in predicting default particularly one year before financial distress. Prediction remained sound even five years before distress with accuracy rates above 78% and AUROC values above 0.79. No single methodology, however, had the best classification ability across different time scales and variable sets. External environmental influences exist, but these influences are weak. In terms of similarity with Moody's ranking, both SMO and logistic regression models are better than the neural network model, with SMO being slightly better than logistic regression. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The characteristics of text databases are quite different from those of retail transaction databases, and existing mining algorithms cannot handle text databases efficiently because of the large number of itemsets (i.e., sets of words) that need to be counted. The new PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning (MIHP) algorithm (Holt, Chung in: Proc of the 14th IEEE int'l conf on tools with artificial intelligence, 2002, pp 49-56), which was shown to be quite efficient than other existing algorithms in the context of mining text databases. The PMIHP algorithm reduces the overhead of communication between miners running on different processors because they are mining local databases asynchronously and prune the global candidates by using the Inverted Hashing and Pruning technique. Compared with the well-known Count Distribution algorithm (Agrawal, Shafer in: (1996) IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng 8(6):962-969), PMIHP demonstrates superior performance characteristics for mining association rules in large text databases, and when the minimum support level is low, its speedup is superlinear as the number of processors increases. These experiments were performed on a cluster of Linux workstations using a collection of Wall Street Journal articles. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.","Cluster computing; Inverted hashing and pruning; Multipass; Parallel association rule mining; Scalability; Text retrieval","Algorithms; Computer operating systems; Database systems; Parallel processing systems; Scalability; Text processing; Cluster computing; Inverted hashing and pruning; Multipass; Parallel association rule mining; Text retrieval; Data mining",,,,,"Ohio Board of Regents, OBR","This research was supported in part by Ohio Board of Regents, LexisNexis, and AFRL/Wright Brothers Institute (WBI).","Agarwal, R.C., Aggarwal, C.C., Prasad, V.V.V., Depth first generation of long patterns (2000) Proc of the 6th ACM SIGKDD int'l conf on knowledge discovery and data mining, pp. 108-118; Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules (1994) Proc of the 20th VLDB conf, pp. 487-499; Agrawal, R., Shafer, J.C., Parallel mining of association rules (1996) IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng, 8 (6), pp. 962-969; Agarwal, R., Aggarwal, C., Prasad, V., A tree projection algorithm for generation of frequent item sets (2001) J Parallel Distrib Comput, 61 (3), pp. 350-371; Bayardo, R.J., Efficient mining long patterns from databases (1998) Proc of ACM SIGMOD int'l conf on management of data, pp. 85-93; Brin, S., Motwani, R., Ullman, J., Tsur, S., Dynamic itemset counting and implication rules for market basket data (1997) Proc of ACM SIGMOD int'l conf on management of data, pp. 255-264; Burdick D, Calimlim M, Gehrke J (2001) MAFIA: a maximal frequent itemset algorithm for transaction databases.

This kind of market with fixed load demand is imperfect. The power companies may use the market power to manipulate the market price and earn more profits. However, the exorbitant price of the generation market may lead to the bankruptcy of power companies and the breakdown of the whole electricity market. Based on the theory of social welfare of economics, a price control model is proposed to apply to this unilateral electricity market to control the electricity price, and insure the stable and highly efficiently running of the electricity market. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model, an artificial intelligence method is adopted to simulate the operation of the market based on the evolutionary game and cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm.

This paper presents a solution that is based on readily available sell-through data from channel partners, such as distributors, to monitor what happens on the market in product introduction situations. The difficulty with using demand information from distributors rather than the POS is the bullwhip effect that distorts demand as you move upstream in the supply chain.

The surveys are important because the proceeds are influenced largely with the selection of the location. However, costs, time and experience are necessary in the surveys. For this reason, this research is intended for the retail stores of small market areas which expend a great deal of money for the surveys. The retail stores of small market areas in this paper are convenience stores. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the optimum number of convenience stores by computer simulation. We adopted the agent model. We constructed an agent model that had the customer agent, the shop agent and the landscape with the kind of necessary minimum parameters. And, we were able to make the simulation environment that reflected the real world.

In order to proactively position the engineers (i.e. resources) so as to service jobs in an optimal manner resource managers are involved in analysing the profiles of engineers in the light of incoming jobs and 'selecting' those profiles that will yield best quality of service (QoS) and reduce operational costs. A profile is a set of attributes that define a resource's capabilities (i.e. skills), capacity (i.e. availability), and location (i.e. area). Resource planning involves identifying an 'optimal' set of resource profiles. Accurate workload forecasting is sine qua non for optimal resource planning. To this end we have developed ARMS, Automated Resource Management System, a suite of components for workload forecasting and resource planning.",,"Artificial intelligence; Forecasting; Management information systems; Operations research; Optimization; Personnel; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Telecommunication services; British telecommunications; Field engineers; Job allocation; Resource management; Resource planning; Telecommunication industry",,,,,,,"Box, G., Jenkins, G., Time series analysis, forecasting and control (1994), Revised Edition, Holden Day; Simpson, J., Noble, A., Egan, B., Morton, D., Richards, T., Burstin, M., Experience in applying OR techniques to the solution of practical resource management problems (1995) BT Technol J, 13 (1), pp. 16-28. , (January); Laithwaite, R., Work allocation challenges and solutions in a large-scale work management environment (1995) BT Technol J, 13 (1), pp. 46-54. , (January); Azarmi, N., Smith, R., Intelligent scheduling and planning systems for telecommunications resource management (1995) BT Technol J, 13 (1), pp. 7-15. , (January); Buchanan, J.T., Mathematical programming and resource management (1995) BT Technol J, 13 (1), pp. 29-36. , (January); Lesaint, D., Voudouris, C., Azarmi, A., Dynamic workforce scheduling for British telecommunications plc (2000) Interfaces Journal, Edelman Award Issue, 30 (11), pp. 45-56; Glover, F.W., Laguna, M., Tabu search (1997), Kluwer Academic Publishers; Glover, F., Future paths for integer programming and links to artificial intelligence (1986) Computers & Operations Research, 13, pp. 533-549; Modern heuristic techniques for combinatorial problems (1993), Reeves C R (Ed); Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford; Local search in combinatorial optimisation (1997), Aarts E H L and Lenstra J K (Eds); Wiley; Kirkpatrick, S., Gelatt, C.D., Vecchi, M.P., Optimisation by simulated annealing (1993) Science, 220, pp. 671-680; Laporte, G., Osman, I.H., Routing problems: A bibliography (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 61, pp. 227-262; Le Pape, C., Implementation of resource constraints in ILOG SCHEDULE: A library for the development of constraint-based scheduling systems (1994) Intelligent Systems Engineering, 2, pp. 55-66; Azarmi, N., Abdul-Hameed, W., Workforce scheduling with constraint logic programming (1985) BT Technol J, 13 (1), pp. 81-94. , (January); Tsang, E.P.K., Scheduling techniques - A comparative study (1995) BT Technol J, 13 (1), pp. 16-28. , (January); Voudouris, C., Dorne, R., Lesaint, D., Liret, A., iOpt - A software toolkit for heuristic search methods, principles and practice of constraint programming (2001) Lecture Notes in Computer Science 2239, pp. 716-729. , CP 2001, in Walsh T (Ed); Springer; Voudouris, C., Dorne, R., Integrating heuristic search and one-way constraints in the iOpt Toolkit (2002) Operations Research/Computer Science Interfaces, 18, pp. 177-192. , Optimization Software Class Libraries, in Voss S and Woodruff D (Eds); Chapter 6; Kluwer Academic Publishers; Jin, B., Malpass, J., Voudouris, C., A study on workstack forecast improvement for resource management in BT (2000), Internal BT Report (September); Gaynor, P.E., Kirkpatrick, R.C., Introduction to time-series modelling and forecasting in business and economics (1994), p. 469. , McGraw-Hill; Makridakis, S., Wheelwright, S., McGee, V., (1983) 'Forecasting: Methods and Application', 2nd Edition, p. 346. , Wiley; Hansen, B.E., Sample splitting and threshold estimation (2000) Econometrica, 68 (3); Efstatiou, J., Editorial (1994) Intelligent Systems Engineering, , (Summer); Walker, P., Future development of resource management for the engineering workforce within BTUK: Technical programmes unit (1998), Internal BT Report","Owusu, G.; BT Exact, Adastral Park, Martlesham Heath, Ipswich, Suffolk IP5 3RE, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,13583948,,BTTJE,,"English","BT Technol J",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345479174

The paper outlines the unique aspects of such systems in relation to commercially available systems. These aspects are seen to be their ability to process and use knowledge on the one hand and information external to the organization on the other. The systems use nonlinear models, optimization, and learning algorithms to provide decision support capabilities for the generic price-setting problem. The general theme of the paper is to see the systems described within this paper as the support tools for a generic price setting process. The description of the systems start with a generic one for pricing decision support in any consumer market and is then specialized to various markets each of which could benefit from a specific variant of the generic pricing technology which has been adapted to that particular industry. The adaptations from the generic pricing system to the systems for petrol pricing, retail pricing, and telecommunications taxation, have been explained. These three examples show a variety of price-setting situations ranging from near commodity pricing, as in the case of petrol, to pricing of very sophisticated services, as in the case of mobile telephony. Field experiments with these systems show that they perform significantly better than unassisted human decision-makers. This is seen from controlled experiments where these systems have demonstrated significant profit uplift when applied to the experimentation sites as compared to the ""control"" sites where the systems have not been applied.","Decision support systems; Decision technologies; Intelligent systems; Price-setting process","Artificial intelligence; Competition; Consumer products; Costs; Decision support systems; Learning algorithms; Marketing; Mathematical models; Optimization; Generic pricing system; Intelligent systems; Mobile telephony; Price setting process; Learning systems",,,,,,,"Sage, A.P., (1991) Decision Support Systems Engineering, , New York: Wiley; Singh, M.G., Knowledge support systems for smarter tactical decisions for pricing and resource allocation (1991) IEEE Contr.

The volume of data collected is enormous (a single UK grocery superstore carries over 15000 different lines, each with a unique 13 digit barcode and will sell 600000 items per week). It has been recognized that, where point of sale data can be translated into meaningful information, there is scope for efficiency savings and exploitable competitive advantage. In UK grocery retailing the uses of scanner data have concentrated on operational aspects such as improved ordering systems and staff scheduling. There have, however, been many recent studies, predomi­nantly in the USA, which have examined, using scanner data, the relationship between marketing variables (price, display, advertising, coupons, and other promotions) and customer purchasing behaviour. This paper presents an overview of these studies and identifies the opportunities for operational researchers to further the understanding of such relationships through modelling and data handling. © 1995 Operational Research Society Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; Marketing; Retailing","Artificial intelligence; Bar codes; Competition; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Data handling; Information management; Laser applications; Operations research; Purchasing; Scanning; Scheduling; Laser scanning; Retailing; Scanner data; Marketing",,,,,,,"Gill, N., Computers in retailing (1993) Comp.

When the number of variables describing the promotion is large relative to the historical database of past promotions, traditional forecasting approaches cannot be applied. In such cases, retailers must rely on the expertise of their buyers to subjectively estimate promotional unit sales. This research develops a Case-Based Reasoning system that allows all buyers to forecast promotional sales as accurately as the organization's expert buyer and, by making the subjective process explicit, also provides an avenue to improve forecast performance over time. The system (1) selects the historical analogs that are most similar to the planned promotion, (2) adjusts the sales of each analog to account for any differences between the analog and the planned promotion, and (3) combines the forecasts derived from the multiple analogs to arrive at a single sales projection.

In particular, they exclude from consideration a kind of system which uses Electronic Point of Sale (EPOS) data to structure unstructured managerial perceptions, but several examples of these systems have been successfully implemented. Methodologies may be more domain specific than they were thought to be, and may hold back implementations to an artificially imposed level of difficulty. Nonetheless, analysis of the level of structure found in a problem is useful, as it points out possible trouble spots, and Fuzzy/Complex analysis was felt to be the most suitable methodology for retail due to its manufacturing origins, clarity of purpose, and flexibility.

The major ingredients for deciding where to locate branch-banks are: growth rates of deposits and loans; degree of competition; easy accessibility, and operating costs of potential sites. These are often highly sensitive to socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral factors that are ill-defined and fuzzy in nature. Accordingly, the traditional normative approach alone cannot analyze the excessive location-related data associated with the external factors and cannot appropriately evaluate behavioral criteria for branch-bank sites. In order to overcome these difficulties, this paper develops an interactive fuzzy goal programming model embedded within a locational decision support system for branch-banks. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed model-based DSS, it has been applied to establish real-world-like location scenarios for commercial branch-banks in Columbus, Ohio. © 1989.","Decision support systems; Fuzzy multicriteria decision making; Retail location","Behavioral factors; Columbus; External factors; Fuzzy goal-programming model; Fuzzy multicriteria decision making; Highly sensitive; Model-based; Potential sites; Real-world; Retail location; Socio-economic; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Location; Operating costs; Decision Theory and Analysis; Marketing--Management; Mathematical Techniques--Fuzzy Sets; Decision making; Management; Banks Location; Decision Support Systems; Multicriteria Decision Making",,,,,,,"Bandyopadhyay, Operational Research in Development Banking in India (1978) European Journal of Operational Research, 2 (1), pp. 8-25; Bell, Zabriskie, Assisting Marketing Decisions by Computer Mapping A Branch Banking Application (1978) Journal of Marketing Research, 15, pp. 122-128; Carter, Cohen, The Use of Simulation in Selecting Branch Banks (1967) Industrial Management Review, 8 (2), pp. 55-69; Clawson, Fitting Branch Locations Performance Standards and Marketing Strategies to Local Conditions (1974) Journal of Marketing, 38, pp. 8-14; Doyle, Fenwick, Savage, Model for Evaluating Branch Location and Performance (1981) Journal of Bank Research, 12, pp. 90-95; Dyer, Mulvey, Integrating Optimization Models with Information Systems for Decision Support (1983) Building Decision Support Systems, , J.L.
