As essential elements of distribution grids, user-side smart meters find many smart grid applications, for example to measure electrical energy use and facilitate communications. However, the service models of distribution grids remain under development in association with upgrading of user-side smart meters. These meters are resource constrained, and challenging to upgrade on a large scale. To address this issue, this article describes a container-driven service architecture, in which containers are used to create a virtual dedicated agent (digital twin) for each user-side smart meter. The agent can be deployed either in the cloud or on an edge system, and can be upgraded to support emerging smart grid applications, thus minimizing the future upgrading requirements of user-side smart meters. We built experimental test beds to verify the proposed architecture and evaluated its performance in real-world experiments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Cloud/edge computing; container; digital twin; meter upgrading; smart meter,Architecture; Electric power transmission networks; Smart meters; Smart power grids; Voltage distribution measurement; Cloud/edge computing; Distribution grid; Edge computing; Essential elements; Grid users; Information and Communication Technologies; Low-voltage distributions; Meter upgrading; Services Architectures; Smart grid applications; Containers,,,,,,,,"Ding, Y.M., Hong, S.H., Li, X.H., A demand response energy management scheme for industrial facilities in smart grid (2014) IEEE Trans.

However, the data transmission bandwidth and sensor placement limitations in the physical systems may not allow us to collect the amount or the type of data that we wish. Recently, a physics-based compressive sensing (PBCS) approach was proposed to monitor manufacturing processes and obtain high-fidelity information with the reduced number of sensors by incorporating physical models of processes in compressed sensing. It can recover and reconstruct complete three-dimensional temperature distributions based on some limited measurements. In this paper, a constrained orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is developed for PBCS, where coherence exists between the measurement matrix and the basis matrix. The efficiency of recovery is improved by introducing a boundary-domain reduction approach, which reduces the size of PBCS model matrices during the inverse operations. The improved PBCS method is demonstrated with the measurement of temperature distributions in the cooling and real-time printing processes of fused filament fabrication. © 2021 by ASME",Compressed sensing; Computational foundations for additive manufacturing; Digital twin; Inverse methods for engineering applications; PDE constrained optimization; Physics-based compressive sensing; Process modeling for engineering applications; Process monitoring,3D printers; Compressed sensing; Digital twin; Inverse problems; Temperature distribution; Additive manufacturing process; Compressive sensing; Inverse operation; Manufacturing process; Measurement matrix; Measurement of temperature; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Three dimensional temperature distributions; Matrix algebra,,,,,,,,"Tao, F., Zhang, M., Nee, A.

Therefore, using measured data to analyze the safety of equipment operation will become an important application of digital twin technology. This paper proposes a switching transient overvoltage modeling method for circuit breakers in distribution networks based on measured data. Through collecting the actual operation data of the 10 kV distribution network circuit breaker, the key operation parameters of the circuit breaker are extracted and the model parameters are iterated and modified accordingly. Moreover, the simulation model can reflect the status of the current operating equipment and improve the reliability of the analysis results. The simulation results show that the maximum distribution overvoltage calculated by this model is 3.88, and it is closer to the measured value compared with the traditional model. This model can be used to analyze the operation safety of distribution network circuit breaker. © 2021, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

First, an asynchronous real-time HIL simulation platform is introduced to enable multi-rate co-simulation of a distribution system with many inverter-based distributed energy resources (DERs). The distribution system is modeled by milliseconds phasor-based models and the DERs are modeled by micro-seconds power electronic models. Communication connections between a centralized volt-var controller (modeled externally to the HIL testbed) and smart inverters are built by implementing Modbus links and the Long Term Evolution network. On this co-simulation platform, an enhanced, augmented Lagrangian multiplier based encoded data recovery (EALM-EDR) algorithm for mitigating the impact of unreliable communication is developed and validated. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of using the HIL-based co-simulation platform as a power grid digital twin for developing algorithms that coordinate a large number of heterogeneous control systems through wired and wireless communication links. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Augmented Lagrangian multiplier; data recovery; distribution; hardware-in-the-loop; volt-var control,Constrained optimization; Digital twin; Electric inverters; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Encoding (symbols); Energy resources; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Lagrange multipliers; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Signal encoding; Value engineering; Augmented Lagrangians; Communication connection; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution systems; Encoding methods; Hardware in the loops; Heterogeneous control; Wired and wireless communications; Simulation platform,,,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Pacific Northwest National lab, Total S.A., and the Department of Energy SunLamp Program for its support to this research project.",,"(1547) Photovoltaics, Distributed Generation, and Energy Storage, IEEE Standard for Interconnection and Interoperability of Distributed Energy Resources with Associated Electric Power Systems Interfaces-Amendment 1: To Provide More Flexibility for Adoption of Abnormal Operating Performance Category III, , IEEE Standard-2018, 2018; Baker, K., Bernstein, A., Dall'Anese, E., Zhao, C., Network-cognizant voltage droop control for distribution grids (2018) IEEE Trans.

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level. To sum up, improving the smart city's IoT-BDA system using the DL approach can reduce data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and offer actual efficacy, providing experimental references for the digital development of smart cities in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Big data analysis; Deep learning; Digital twins; Internet of Things; Smart city,Big data; Convolutional neural networks; Data communication systems; Data handling; Deep learning; E-learning; Energy efficiency; Information analysis; Probability distributions; Smart city; Big data analyse; Convolutional neural network; Data analysis system; Data-transmission; Deep learning; Distributed parallelism; Massive data; Multihop transmission; Multisource data; Parallelism strategies; Internet of things,,,,,"2019JZZY020101; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 41971341, 41971354, 61902203; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province: 2019A1515010748, 2019A1515011872","This work is Funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41971341 , 41971354 , 61902203 ), General Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (Grant No. 2019A1515010748 , 2019A1515011872 ), Key Research and Development Plan - Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of ShanDong Province, China ( 2019JZZY020101 ).",,"Alzahrani, S.M., Sensing for the Internet of Things and its applications (2017) In 2017 5th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops, FiCloudW, pp. 88-92. , IEEE; Al-Ali, A.R., Gupta, R., Zaman Batool, T., Landolsi, T., Aloul, F., Al Nabulsi, A., Digital twin conceptual model within the context of Internet of Things (2020) Future Internet, 12 (10), p. 163; El Marai, O., Taleb, T., Song, J., Roads infrastructure digital twin: A step toward smarter cities realization (2020) IEEE Netw., pp. 1-8; Austin, M., Delgoshaei, P., Coelho, M., Heidarinejad, M., Architecting smart city digital twins: combined semantic model and machine learning approach (2020) J.

The solution reports the values of the quantities and alarms of operation remotely and almost in real-time. The development of this solution seeks to provide an electrical grid with greater reliability, proposing the reduction of KPIs (Key Performance Indicator), such as SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index) and SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index), through more transparent monitoring of the behavior of the electrical distribution grid and its equipment. Through the research and development (R&D) project Urban Futurability, ENEL (Ente nazionale per l’energia elettrica) Distribution São Paulo seeks to apply the solution by implementing the concept of smart grids, an idea that has been growing each year by virtue of technological developments and the employment of new sensors in electrical distribution grids.

The overall framework, operation process and key technologies of the system implementation is established, using the Zigbee self-organizing network function to monitor and collect real-time data such as wind speed, gas and dust concentration in the roadway. The ARIMA time series prediction model is used to intelligently predict and analyze the gas and dust concentration at the next moment, moreover the niche four-segment coding genetic algorithm is introduced to extract the corresponding intelligent control rules of airflow, and combined with GPRS wireless transmission technology to realize the intelligent control of airflow status of air outlet. On this basis, Unity3D is used to construct the virtual model of the system and realize the mapping interaction between the physical entity and the virtual twin. Through the design and construction of the digital twin system experimental test platform, the technical feasibility of system's key function such as real-time monitoring, decision-making evaluation, intelligent control, and virtual-real integration are verified, besides combined with specific cases to compare and analyze the intelligent control effect of system. The results shows that after adjustment, the wind speed at the driver's position increases significantly. The gas concentration at the top corner is reduced from 0.623% to 0.306%, and the reduction rate reaches 50.8%. The dust concentration at the driver's position is reduced from 1 180 mg/m3 to 695 mg/m3, and the single-point dust reduction rate reached 41.1%, the dust concentration along the pedestrian height at the return air side is reduced from 430 mg/m3 to 150 mg/m3, and the dust re-duction rate reaches 65%, which further optimize the distribution of wind speed, gas and dust field in the heading face. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of China Coal Society.

The advanced digital twin technology is introduced into tooth flank grinding. A new digital twin modeling considering low-risk transmission performances is proposed. In the modeling, low-risk transmission performance driven simulation, sensitivity analysis and robust control are developed, respectively Firstly, data-driven tooth surface modeling is developed by simulating free-form tooth surface grinding including gear tilt method and pinion double helical method. With local geometric boundary setup meshing stiffness is determined by using local Rayleigh–Ritz solution. Then, to deal with the sensitivity of gear assembly, an improved tooth contact analysis (TCA) is developed. Moreover, numerical loaded tooth contact analysis (NLTCA) is performed to build a bridge between of low-risk performances and hypoid generator parameters. The low-risk transmission performance driven control model is established by using hypoid generator parameters modification. Finally, sensitivity analysis strategy-based robust control model is solved by using Levenberg–Marquardt method for accurate hypoid generator parameters having modification amount. The provided numerical instance can verify the proposed method. © 2021 ISA",Digital twin modeling; Free-form tooth surface grinding; Low-risk transmission performance; Non-orthogonal aviation spiral bevel gears;

Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model's security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system's multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100&#x0025; successful transmission probability and 0.01~0.05 &#x03BB; value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.

In this paper, posture perception, numerical simulation, and risk assessment are adopted to realize the deep fusion of physical trajectory and spatial virtual electric field distribution of live worker, and digital twin bodies of live worker in different live working scenarios are constructed. Firstly, posture trajectories and 3D model of living worker in typical operation conditions are captured and reconstructed by full-body inertial action capture technology and this technology use motion capture unit which include 3-aixs accelerometer/gyroscope/magnetic field sensors. The length of complex gap and body workspace under various live work scenes are also calculated. By static electrical field finite element (FE) numerical modeling, surface electrical field distributions of live worker under different posture trajectories are then calculated. Finally, interactive mechanism between 'body-information-physical environment-virtual environment' is introduced, and potential risk of live worker is on-line assessed by live work guide rules. This work develops a new assessment and protection method for virtual training and field operations of high-voltage live worker. Which is of great significance for enhancing operation level and ensuring living workers' safety. © 2013 IEEE.",data twin; intelligence; Live work,Digital twin; Electric fields; Electric lines; Numerical models; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Three dimensional computer graphics; Trajectories; Transmissions; High voltage transmission lines; Motion capture units; Operation conditions; Physical environments; Protection methods; Surface electrical fields; Virtual electric field; Working environment; Occupational risks,,,,,038700KK52170007,"This work was supported by the Science and Technology Project of Guangdong Power Grid Company Ltd., under Project 038700KK52170007.",,"Method of operation of live working, Electric Power Press, State Grid Corp.

In the first stage, an experimental investigation is carried out and a corresponding 1-D GT-Power simulation model is developed and validated by the experimental data for an Otto cycle engine and then modified into the Atkinson cycle engine. In the second stage, the digital twins engine model takes the spark timing, exhaust gas recirculation rate, intake variable valve timing, exhaust variable valve timing as well as lambda as the inputs of the simulation optimization platform for the Atkinson cycle engine. The optimum values of aforementioned input parameters are identified by the evolutionary non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to minimize the brake specific fuel consumption and nitric oxide under different speeds and loads, the reduction rates of fuel consumption and nitric oxide are decreased by up to 12.48% and 92.64%, respectively. In the third stage, the optimized performance MAPs are implemented in the series hybrid electric vehicle with the Atkinson cycle engine, the results show that the cumulative fuel consumption and nitric oxide volume fraction of the optimized vehicle under new European driving cycle reduced by 4.58% and 46.1%, respectively. It is concluded that the proposed evolutionary non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm method can identify the optimum conditions of vehicle well and improve its fuel economy as well as emission. Furthermore, the combined simulation platform for both engine and vehicle can be applied to evaluate and optimize the energy distribution and performance of vehicles with different technologies or strategies in the future. Besides, all these will provide theoretical basis and digital model support for the development of efficient and energy-saving new energy vehicles. © 2020",Atkinson engine; Evolutionary non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm; Exhaust gas recirculation rate; Fuel consumption; NO emissions; Series hybrid electric vehicle,Digital twin; Electric sparks; Energy conservation; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuel economy; Fuels; Genetic algorithms; MATLAB; Nitric oxide; Otto cycle; Simulation platform; Sorting; Vehicle performance; Brake specific fuel consumption; Exhaust gas recirculation rates; Experimental investigations; Matlab/Simulink software; Multi-objective evolutionary optimizations; New european driving cycles; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Series hybrid electric vehicles; Hybrid vehicles,,,,,"National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, NIDCD: DC00189-01, DC01508","This work is supported by grants from the American Otologic Society, Inc., the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, NIDCD Grant DC00189-01 (L.

In this study, we introduce an open micro energy grid platform to operate the widely distributed microgrids in Korea. Subsequently, we present commercial microgrid business models supported by the open micro energy grid platform equipped with an artificial intelligence engine and provide test results from testbeds connected to the platform. In contrast to the existing microgrid business models in the market, we propose a universal architecture and business model of the future microgrid, comprising (i) an energy robot-management operation business model, (ii) electric vehicle-based demand response, (iii) blockchain technology for energy trading, and (iv) a service-oriented business model. Finally, we propose a new business model for an intelligent virtual power plant (VPP) operator along with the architecture of the VPP and its proof of concept (PoC). We expect the proposed business model to provide energy solution providers with guidelines to develop various VPP services. © 2019 by the authors.

Suitable tools are needed that can harness advanced control and machine learning techniques to achieve environmental, economic and resilience objectives. In this paper, an energy management tool is presented that can offer optimal control, scheduling, forecasting and coordination services to energy assets across a district, enabling optimal decisions under user-defined objectives. The tool presented here can coordinate different sub-systems in a district to avoid the violation of high-level system constraints and is designed in a generic fashion to enable transferable use across different energy sectors. The work demonstrates the potential for a single open-source optimisation framework to be applied across multiple energy vectors, providing local government the opportunity to manage different assets in a coordinated fashion. This is shown through case studies that integrate low-carbon communal heating for social housing with electric vehicle charge-point management to achieve high-level system constraints and local government objectives in the borough of Greenwich, London. The paper illustrates the theoretical methodology, the software architecture and the digital twin-based testing environment underpinning the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Building energy; Machine learning; Smart cities; Transport energy; Urban energy systems,Digital twin; Energy management; Internet of things; Open source software; Scheduling; Software testing; Vector control (Electric machinery); Coordination and Control; High-level systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine learning techniques; Optimal controls; Optimal decisions; Smart energy systems; Testing environment; Learning systems,,,,,"EP/S016627/1; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 691895; Greater London Authority, GLA; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Horizon 2020","This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 691895 and the EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences) under the Active Building Centre project (reference number: EP/S016627/1).

Based on the system state equation methodology, the dual real-virtual system representation for parallel systems is presented, based on which the parallel system problem is described in mathematical forms. Further, the computational framework for the ACP approach, which explain in details the mathematical processes for artificial systems (A), computational experiments (C) and parallel execution (P). Based on the ACP approach framework, concepts such as ""learning and training"", ""experiments and evaluation"", ""management and control"" are mapped into ACP's mathematical computational framework, as well as related concepts such as AFC (Agile- Focus-Convergence) and ""small data, big data, small intelligence"". The synergy of parallel system framework and artificial intelligence technology is also discussed and investigated, leading to the origin and implications of ""parallel intelligence"". A campus-wide energy management problem with considerations of human factors is utilized as an illustrative example of applying the parallel system mathematical representation and computational framework in power and energy systems.

The microgrid research field is also evolving to enable intelligent operation of energy management through digitalization. Problems occur when operating the actual microgrid, causing issues such as difficulty in decision making and system abnormalities. Using digital twin technology, which is one of the technologies representing the fourth industrial revolution, it is possible to overcome these problems by changing the microgrid configuration and operating algorithms of virtual space in various ways and testing them in real time. In this study, we proposed an energy storage system (ESS) operation scheduling model to be applied to virtual space when constructing a microgrid using digital twin technology. An ESS optimal charging/discharging scheduling was established to minimize electricity bills and was implemented using supervised learning techniques such as the decision tree, NARX, and MARS models instead of existing optimization techniques. NARX and decision trees are machine learning techniques. MARS is a nonparametric regression model, and its application has been increasing. Its performance was analyzed by deriving performance evaluation indicators for each model. Using the proposed model, it was found in a case study that the amount of electricity bill savings when operating the ESS is greater than that incurred in the actual ESS operation. The suitability of the model was evaluated by a comparative analysis with the optimization-based ESS charging/discharging scheduling pattern. © 2020 by the authors.",Digital twin; Energy storage system; Machine learning; Microgrid; Optimal scheduling,Decision making; Decision trees; Digital storage; Digital twin; Electric energy storage; Microgrids; Regression analysis; Scheduling; Supervised learning; Energy storage systems; Evaluation indicators; Industrial revolutions; Information and Communication Technologies; Intelligent operations; Machine learning techniques; Non-parametric regression; Optimization techniques; Learning systems,,,,,"20A01110; Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, KERI; National Research Council of Science and Technology, NST","Funding: This research was supported by the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI) primary research program through the National Research Council of Science and Technology (NST) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea (No. 20A01110).","Acknowledgments: This research was supported by the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI) primary research program through the National Research Council of Science and Technology (NST) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea (No. 20A01110).","www.energy.or.kr, Korea Energy Agency.

A promising approach, which has been discovered recently as key technology by several industries is the Digital Twin (DT) concept. A DT connects the virtual representation of a physical object, system or process by available information and sensor data streams, which allows to gather new information about the system it mirrors by applying analytic functions. Thereby the DT technology can help to fill sensor data gaps, e. g., to support anomaly detection, and to predict future operating conditions and system states. This paper discusses a dynamic power system DT as a cornerstone instance of a new generation of EMS, and a prospective new EMS architecture, to support the increasingly complex operation of electric power systems. Unlike in traditional offline power system models, the parameters are updated dynamically using measurement information from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and a wide area monitoring system (WAMS) to tune the model. This allows to derive a highly accurate virtual representation of the mirrored physical objects. A simulation engine, the Digital Dynamic Mirror (DDM) is introduced, in order to be able to reproduce the state of a reference network in real-time. The validation of the approach is carried out by a case study. In a closed loop within EMS applications, the DDM can help to assess contingency mitigation strategies, thus it can support the decision-making process under variable system conditions. The next generation of control centre Energy Management System (EMS) can benefit from this development by augmentation of the dynamic observability, and the rise of operator situation awareness. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.",assistant system; control centre; cyber-physical system; decision support; Digital Twin; EMS; situation awareness,,,,,,,,,"Handschin, E., Petroianu, A., (1991) Energy management systems: Operation and control of electric energy transmission systems, , Berlin Springer; Liu, Y., Wu, L., Li, J., D-PMU based applications for emerging active distribution systems: A review (2020) Electric Power Systems Research, 179; Prostejovsky, A.M., Bindner, H.W., Kosek, A.M., Kok, K., (2017) Increased Observability in Electric Distribution Grids: Emerging Applications Promoting the Active Role of Distribution System Operators, , PhD Dissertation Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark; Biagini, V., Subasic, M., Oudalov, A., Kreusel, J., The autonomous grid: Automation, intelligence and the future of power systems (2020) Energy Research & Social Science, 65; Badrzadeh, B., Emin, Z., Hillberg, E., Jacobson, D., Kocewiak, L., Lietz, G., Da Silva, F.F., Val Escudero, M., (2020) CIGRE Science & Engineering (CSE), 17, pp. 30-46. , The Need for Enhanced Power System Modelling Techniques and Simulation Tools; Brosinsky, C., Westermann, D., Krebs, R., (2018) 2018 IEEE International Energy Conference (ENERGYCON), pp. 1-6. , Recent and prospective developments in power system control centers: Adapting the digital twin technology for application in power system control centers Limassol, Cyprus; Zhao, J., Gomez-Exposito, A., Netto, M., Mili, L., Abur, A., Terzija, V., Kamwa, I., Meliopoulos, A.P.S., Power System Dynamic State Estimation: Motivations, Definitions, Methodologies, and Future Work (2019) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 34 (4), pp. 3188-3198; Sass, F., Sennewald, T., Westermann, D., Automated Corrective Actions by VSC-HVDC-systems: A novel Remedial Action Scheme (2019) IEEE Trans.

Besides forecasting a machine’s life expectancy, the virtual models allow GE to optimize the operation of its products. GE says digital twins are increasing the amount of electricity wind farms produce by as much as 20 percent and reducing annual fuel consumption and carbon emissions for one of its locomotives by 32,000 gallons and 174,000 tons a year, respectively. The technology depends on artificial intelligence to continually update itself. What’s more, if data is corrupted or missing, the company fills in the gaps with the aid of machine learning, a type of AI that lets computers learn without being explicitly programmed. To develop and work with these systems, GE researchers need to understand both the physics of the machines and the AI algorithms. Sahika Genc, another dual scientist, developed systems for ICU alarms before transitioning to GE’s machine learning lab in 2014. Genc is now a machine-learning scientist who uses deep learning and reinforcement learning to make GE’s energy management systems more efficient.",,Artificial intelligence; Carbon; Energy management systems; Engines; Reinforcement learning; Wind power; AI algorithms; Carbon emissions; General electrics; Life expectancies; Virtual models; Wind farm; Learning systems,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,,,,,1099274X,,TEREA,,English,Technol Rev,Article,Final,,Scopus,

This paper explores the use of an urban building energy model (UBEM) to examine the potential for creating a near-zero carbon neighbourhood in Dublin (Ireland) that is characterised by diverse land-uses and old and new building stock. UBEMs are a relatively new tool that allows the simulation of building energy demand across an urbanised landscape and can account for building layout, including the effects of overshadowing and the potential for facade retrofits and energy generation. In this research, a novel geographic database of buildings is created using archetypes, and the associated information on dimensions, fabric and energy systems is integrated into the Urban Modelling Interface (UMI). The model is used to simulate current and future energy demand based on climate change projections and to test scenarios that apply retrofits to the existing stock and that link proximate land-uses and land-covers. The latter allows a significant decoupling of the neighbourhood from an offsite electricity generation station with a high carbon output. The findings of this paper demonstrate that treating neighbourhoods as single energy entities rather than collections of individual sectors allows the development of bespoke carbon reducing scenarios that are geographically situated. The work shows the value of a neighbourhood-based approach to energy management using UBEMs. © 2021 by the authors.

Those latter will comprehend several energy generators, traditional and/or from renewable energy sources (RESs), different energy storage systems using several energy vectors and that interconnect different energy-consuming sectors (power, thermal, transport sectors) and that fully exploit the potential synergies offered by such interconnected system. Nevertheless, since the first conceptualisation of digital twins in the first years of the 21st century, its use has not started yet for different reasons that are affecting the adoption of this game-changer approach. Hence, what are the main barriers that are holding back the adoption of digital twins in smart energy systems? The present review paper answers this research question while discussing the case studies that can be found in literature and analysing the different approaches and the system architectures that have been tested or simply idealised. This paper provides a basis for future research that aims at applying the digital twin concept in the energy sector and particularly for power grid management. It deals with the challenges of big data management, the ones related to real-time measurements and continuous communication between the real-world system and its digital twin, the investment for measuring systems, the issues connected with the use of large data centres and the correlated energy-related challenges and doubts. The review analyses the challenges that have been encountered so far, the proposed solutions and the opportunities that such a ‘work in progress’ topic offers. © 2021 WIT Press,",Barriers; Digital twin; Energy systems; Modelling; Real-time analyses,,,,,,,,,"Mai, T.T., Jadun, P., Logan, J.S., McMillan, C.A., Muratori, M., Steinberg, D.C., Vimmerstedt, L.J., Nelson, B., (2018) Electrification Futures Study: Scenarios of Electric Technology Adoption and Power Consumption for the United States, , https://doi.org/10.2172/1459351, United States: N; Philipp, G., Singaravel, S., Component-based machine learning for performance prediction in building design (2018) Applied Energy, 228, pp. 1439-1453. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.011; Grieves, M., Vickers, J., Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems (2017) Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Complex Systems, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-38756-7_4, Kahlen F.J., Flumerfelt, S., Alves, A.

In order to achieve optimal energy management of solar cars, it is necessary to comprehensively characterize the energy flow of vehicular components. To model these components which are hard to formulate, this study stim-ulates a solar car with the digital twin (DT) technology to accurately characterize energy. Based on the hybrid modeling approach combining mechanistic and data-driven technologies, the DT model of a solar car is established with a designed cloud platform server based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to realize data interaction between physical and virtual entities. The DT model is further modified by the offline optimization data of drive motors, and the energy consumption is evaluated with the DT system in the real-world experiment. Specifically, the energy consumption error between the experiment and simulation is less than 5.17%, which suggests that the established DT model can accurately stimulate energy consumption. Generally, this study lays the foundation for subsequent performance optimization research. © 2021 by the authors.

This approach allows to link the thermodynamic and mechanical model of a gas turbine with its control system while bypassing the necessity to model the electrical generator. A non-dimensional group, called Aergia number, has been experimentally correlated with the measured electrical power output through a linear function. The Aergia number reproduces with accuracy the electrical power output during both steady state and transient operation. Furthermore, the proven linearity of the model implies that, in principle, its implementation requires the knowledge of just two data points during steady state operation. The model has been validated using two experimental facilities within the ENEA Casaccia Research Center, each equipped with a Turbec T100 S3 micro gas turbine, but characterized by different gas paths. Furthermore, the same linearity relation has been confirmed for aeroderivative and heavy duty single-, dual-, and triple-shaft gas turbines with power outputs ranging from 2 to 330 MWel.

The surrogate-assisted strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SSPEA) is developed to optimize the power-split control parameters guided by the data from the physical PHEV and its digital twins. By introducing a ''confidence factor'', the SSPEA uses the fused data of physically measured and virtually simulated vehicle performances (energy consumption and remaining battery state-of-charge) to converge the optimization process. Gaussian noisy models are adopted to emulate the real vehicle system on the hardware-in-the-loop platform for experimental evaluation. The testing results suggest that the proposed SSPEA requires less R&amp;D costs than the model-free method that only uses the physical information, and more than 44.6% energy can be saved during the R&amp;D process. Driven by the SSPEA, the optimized energy management system surpasses other non-DT-assisted systems by saving more than 4.8% energy.

However, several challenges including excessively long waiting time and a serious waste of energy still exist on the shop-floor where limited buffer exists for each machine (e.g., shop-floor that manufactures large-size products). The production logistics tasks are released after work-in-processes (WIPs) are processed, and the machines will be occupied before trolleys arrival when using passive material handling strategy. To address this issue, a proactive material handling method for CPS enabled shop-floor (CPS-PMH) is proposed. Firstly, the manufacturing resources (machines and trolleys) are made smart by applying CPS technologies so that they are able to sense, act, interact and behave within a smart environment. Secondly, a shop-floor digital twin model is created, aiming to reflect their status just like real-life objects, and key production performance indicators can be analysed timely. Then, a time-weighted multiple linear regression method (TWMLR) is proposed to forecast the remaining processing time of WIPs. A proactive material handling model is designed to allocate smart trolleys optimally. Finally, a case study from Southern China is used to validate the proposed method and results show that the proposed CPS-PMH can largely reduce the total non-value-added energy consumption of manufacturing resources and optimize the routes of smart trolleys. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Cyber physical system (CPS); Large-size product; Material handling; Prediction model; Remaining processing time; Shop-floor,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Floors; Linear regression; Manufacture; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Large-size product; Material handling; Prediction model; Processing time; Shop floor; Materials handling,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51675441; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program): 2018YFB1703402; Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project: B13044","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial supports of National Science Foundation of China (51675441), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFB1703402), and the 111 Project Grant (B13044).",,"Wang, S., Wan, J., Zhang, D., Li, D., Zhang, C., Towards smart factory for industry 4.0: a self-organized multi-agent system with big data based feedback and coordination (2016) Comput.

We aim to minimize the normalized energy consumption, defined as the energy consumption per bit, by optimizing user association, resource allocation, and offloading probabilities subject to the quality-of-service requirements. The user association is managed by the mobility management entity (MME), while resource allocation and offloading probabilities are determined by each access point (AP). We propose a deep learning (DL) architecture, where a digital twin of the real network environment is used to train the DL algorithm off-line at a central server. From the pre-trained deep neural network (DNN), the MME can obtain user association scheme in a real-time manner. Considering that the real networks are not static, the digital twin monitors the variation of real networks and updates the DNN accordingly. For a given user association scheme, we propose an optimization algorithm to find the optimal resource allocation and offloading probabilities at each AP. The simulation results show that our method can achieve lower normalized energy consumption with less computation complexity compared with an existing method and approach to the performance of the global optimal solution. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",deep learning (DL); digital twin; mobile edge computing (MEC); resource allocation; Ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC); user association,Deep neural networks; E-learning; Edge computing; Energy utilization; Probability; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Computation complexity; digital twin; Global optimal solutions; Low-latency communication; mobile edge computing (MEC); Optimal resource allocation; Optimization algorithms; User associations; 5G mobile communication systems,,,,,"FL160100032; Australian Research Council, ARC: DE150101704, DP150104019, DP190101988","Manuscript received January 16, 2019; revised May 7, 2019 and July 1, 2019; accepted July 2, 2019.

The new generation of machine tools should be digitalized, highly efficient, network-accessible and intelligent. An intelligent machine tool (IMT) driven by the digital twin provides a superior solution for the development of intelligent manufacturing. In this paper, a real-time machining data application and service based on IMT digital twin is presented. Multisensor fusion technology is adopted for real-time data acquisition and processing. Data transmission and storage are completed using the MTConnect protocol and components. Multiple forms of HMIs and applications are developed for data visualization and analysis in digital twin, including the machining trajectory, machining status and energy consumption. An IMT digital twin model is established with the aim of further data analysis and optimization, such as the machine tool dynamics, contour error estimation and compensation. Examples of the IMT digital twin application are presented to prove that the development method of the IMT digital twin is effective and feasible. The perspective development of machining data analysis and service is also discussed. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Data fusion; Data service; Digital twin; Intelligent machine tool; Machining data,Data acquisition; Data fusion; Data visualization; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Error compensation; Information analysis; Machine tools; Manufacture; Data services; Digital twin; Estimation and compensation; Intelligent machine; Intelligent Manufacturing; Machining data; Real-time data acquisition and processing; Visualization and analysis; Data handling,,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2016YFB1102503",The authors would like to present considerable gratitude for the financial support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFB1102503).

A vehicle simulation model of pure battery electric vehicles equipped with single pedal control system is established and calibrated by the experimental data based on vehicle energy flow and driving range analysis, the simulation doesn't include thermal aspect of the battery/vehicle. Next, the effects of different environmental and control parameters on energy consumption and driving range of pure electric vehicles are analyzed. The main findings are: (1) for the single driving cycle, the relative error of battery power and current is below 5%, and the absolute error of battery voltage is below 2.5 V. For the whole driving range, the absolute error of driving range is only about 5.75 km. (2) The main factors influencing energy consumption and driving range are average vehicle speed, running time and the frequency distribution of braking process, besides, the energy consumption of congested traffic with/without regenerative brake control system are 46.07 kW·h/100 km and 47.19 kW·h/100 km, respectively, meanwhile, vehicle with regenerative braking saves 2.43% energy under congested traffic. (3) The threshold of quitting the working condition of energy recovery for the motor can be set in a certain value based on the safety of driver in the emergencies and energy conversion. Further, the model and data in the paper can be applied to evaluate and optimize the energy consumption and driving range by changing different technologies or strategies in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Driving range; Electric vehicles; Energy consumption simulation model using digital twins; Performance prediction; Road traffic; Single pedal control system,Battery electric vehicles; Control systems; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Errors; Regenerative braking; Traffic congestion; Brake control system; Congested traffic; Control parameters; Frequency distributions; Performance characteristics; Pure electric vehicles; Vehicle energy consumption; Vehicle simulation; Secondary batteries; control system; electric vehicle; energy flow; equipment; performance assessment; simulation,,,,,"2017QNRC001; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51776061; Hunan University, HNU","This research paper is jointly sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 51776061 ), and the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program of China Association for Science and Technology (No. 2017QNRC001 ).

Precise usage of cutting tools is believed to improve economic, environmental and social benefits greatly. However, the problem that the physical cutting tool was difficult to be reacted by modelling and simulation of its degradation process made the cutting tool usage, replacement and sharpening lack of reliable support, which affected optimization and control for precise usage of cutting tools and dynamic adjustment of machining system. Based on the concept of digital twin, a digital twin model for cutting tools in machining process was proposed, and its concept, structure, function and running procedure were investigated in detail. Digital twin-driven cutting tool wear condition monitoring, remaining useful life prediction, cutting tool selection decision-making and cutting service were also addressed deeply. A prototype was developed to illustrate and validate the model. Through interaction and fusion of physical cutting tools and virtual models, the digital twin model for cutting tools in machining process enabled an intelligent, proactive and predictive cutting tool management mode to support optimization, decision-making and service. © 2019, Editorial Department of CIMS.

Given the current battery and charging technology, driving experience of EVs relies heavily on the availability and reachability of EV charging infrastructure. As the number of charging piles increases, carefully designed arrangement of resources and efficient utilization of the infrastructure is essential to the future development of EV industry. The mobility and distribution of EVs determine the charging demand and the load of power distribution grid. Then, dynamic traffic pattern of numerous interconnected EVs poses great impact on charging plans and charging infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce the digital twin of a real-world EV by modeling the mobility based on a time series behaviors of EVs to evaluate the charging algorithm and pile arrangement policy. The introduced digital twin EV is a virtually simulated equivalence with same traffic behaviors and charging activities as the EV in real world. The behavior and route choice of EVs is dynamically simulated base on the time-varying driving operations, travel intent, and charging plan in a simulated large-scale charging scenario composed of concurrently moving EVs and correspondingly equipped charging piles. Different EV navigation algorithms and charging algorithms of Internet of Vehicle can be exactly evaluated in the dynamic simulation of the digital twins of the moving EVs and charging infrastructure. Then we analyze the collected data such as energy consumption, charging capacity, charging frequency, and waiting time in queue on both the EV side and the charging pile side to evaluate the charging efficiency.

Container orchestration platforms have emerged to alleviate this problem with prior art either using heuristics to quickly reach scheduling decisions or AI driven methods like reinforcement learning and evolutionary approaches to adapt to dynamic scenarios. The former often fail to quickly adapt in highly dynamic environments, whereas the latter have run-times that are slow enough to negatively impact response time. Therefore, there is a need for scheduling policies that are both reactive to work efficiently in volatile environments and have low scheduling overheads. To achieve this, we propose a Gradient Based Optimization Strategy using Back-propagation of gradients with respect to Input (GOBI). Further, we leverage the accuracy of predictive digital-twin models and simulation capabilities by developing a Coupled Simulation and Container Orchestration Framework (COSCO). Using this, we create a hybrid simulation driven decision approach, GOBI*, to optimize Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Co-simulation and the back-propagation approaches allow these methods to adapt quickly in volatile environments. Experiments conducted using real-world data on fog applications using the GOBI and GOBI∗ methods, show a significant improvement in terms of energy consumption, response time, Service Level Objective and scheduling time by up to 15, 40, 4, and 82 percent respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. © 1990-2012 IEEE.",back-propagation to input; container orchestration; coupled simulation; Fog computing; QoS optimization,Backpropagation; Containers; Energy utilization; Fog; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Predictive analytics; Quality of service; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling; Computing environments; Evolutionary approach; Gradient-based optimization; Low energy consumption; Quality of Service parameters; Service Level Agreements; State-of-the-art algorithms; Volatile environments; Fog computing,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 825040; Imperial College London; European Social Fund, ESF",The work of Shreshth Tuli was supported by the Imperial College London through the President's Ph.D. Scholarship Scheme.

As a new technology, digital twin can fully connect and integrate the physical world and information world in real time, and can effectively promote the integration of informationization and industrialization in the shop-floor. Aiming at the uncertainties in the process of remanufacturing and the situation that information space of virtual remanufacturing and actual remanufacturing process can't be interactively integrated in real time, the digital twin was applied into the remanufacturing operation process, and the architecture for digital twin-based remanufacturing shop-floor was constructed. This architecture and it's operation paradigm were elaborated respectively, the application analyses for key technologies involved was made, and the remanufacturing operation paradigm for automobile based on digital twin in future was also explored. The application prospects for digital twin-based remanufacturing in related fields were discussed. © 2019, Editorial Department of CIMS.

However, the industrial implementation of PEO has been hindered by a poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying plasma-assisted electrochemical coating formation. This study compares the characteristics of PEO processes on different valve metals in a dilute aqueous solution of NaOH and Na2SiO3 under pulsed unipolar and bipolar polarisation conditions. The focus is given to the influence of the nature of the valve metal on the transition to the soft sparking regime characterised by reduced energy consumption whilst yielding sintered coating materials enriched with crystalline phases. In-situ dynamic voltammetry analysis was employed to study the effects of the net current ratio and local negative charge injection using diagnostic pulses embedded in the polarisation signal. It has been demonstrated that soft sparking is a characteristic feature of valve metals such as Mg, Al, Zr and Ta that form insulating surface oxides with negligible electronic conductivity, whereas Ti and Nb form semiconducting oxides, which do not exhibit a characteristic voltage drop, although some features of spark softening were detected. This generalisation paves a way for implementation of a model known as ‘digital twin’ to the rational design of the PEO processes for deposition of the functional ceramics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",Breakdown; Coating; Passivity; Plasma electrolytic oxidation; Soft sparking; Valve metals,Ceramic coatings; Ceramic materials; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant coatings; Deposition; Electrolysis; Energy utilization; Optical properties; Oxidation; Polarization; Silicon compounds; Sodium hydroxide; Titanium oxides; Wear resistance; Breakdown; Eco-friendly technologies; Oxidation process; Oxide coating; Passivity; Plasma electrolytic oxidation; Rational design; Soft sparking; Valve metal; Wear and corrosion resistance; Metals,,,,,"EP/L01680X/1; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/S036180/1, EP/T024607/1","Financial support for research leading to this publication was provided by the UK EPSRC via ‘ NetworkPlus in Digitalised Surface Manufacturing ’ ( EP/S036180/1 ), Future Manufacturing System programme (project EP/T024607/1 , CoatIN) and The Materials for Demanding Environments Centre for Doctoral Training ( EP/L01680X/1 ) with support from BCW Manufacturing Group Ltd and is acknowledged with thanks.",,"Belevantsev, V.I., Terleeva, O.P., Markov, G.A., Shulepko, E.K., Slonova, A.I., Utkin, V.V., Microplasma electrochemical processes (1998) Protect.

Unlike the accelerometers and magnetometers, which are respectively sensitive to vibrations and ferrous materials interference, MEMS type gyroscope is able to provide stable orientation information for a short period of time. Compared with these two sensors, gyroscopes are neither disturbed by vibrations nor affected by metallic materials, and therefore it would be one of the primary sensors for industrial applications. Reviewing the most recently related works, accurate attitude estimations are usually obtained by fusing gyro integration. However, it is well known that series drifts will be induced after a long-term integration. Furthermore, according to the literature and the associated experiments, they all demonstrated that MEMS type gyroscopes have strong temperature correlation because of the silicon structure. Put it simply, the temperature variations will give rise to gyro drifts severely and thereby degrade the orientation estimation precision. To address this problem, this article proposed a temperature modeling technique and a real-time drift pre-compensation procedure by applying autoregressive moving average (ARMA) technology. Different from the traditional modeling methods, the proposed method is able to describe transient drifting behaviors as well as steady state ones. Moreover, comparison studies using artificial neural networks (ANNs) are also presented. Experiments show that the proposed method provides a stable and reliable temperature-caused gyroscope drift pre-compensation. The developed method is also very suitable for the realization in a low-cost embedded system. © 2020 IEEE.",autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model identification; MEMS gyroscope; temperature compensation,Autoregressive moving average model; Costs; Digital twin; Energy utilization; Gyroscopes; Neural networks; Autoregressive moving average; Inertial measurement unit; Low energy consumption; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Orientation estimation; Orientation information; Real-time compensations; Temperature correlation; MEMS,,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST: MOST 107-2221-E-006-114-MY3, MOST 108-2923-E-006-005-MY3","Manuscript received September 11, 2020; accepted September 24, 2020.

The operation of that system needs to be safe and efficient to avoid equipment damage and reduce energy consumption. The stable and secure operation of the equipment in a compression system is provided, many times, by a classical regulatory control layer. In this work, we present a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to provide setpoints for the regulatory control layer of a gas compression system, aiming to avoid excessive energy consumption, decrease the plant variability, and guarantee a stable and safe operation against load disturbances. The proposed method is tested in a digital twin of a typical industrial unit using a Dead-Time Compensator Generalized Predictive Controller (DTC-GPC). Some disturbances in the feed flow rate of gas were considered as case studies. The controller responded satisfactorily to these disturbances keeping the plant operation stable and returning the controlled variables in the desired operating range after a short time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Advanced process control; Compressor control; DTC-GPC; Gas compression system; Model predictive control; Time delay,Controllers; Delay control systems; Energy utilization; Gases; Predictive control systems; Time delay; Advanced Process Control; Compression system; Compressor controls; Control layers; Dead- time compensation; Dead-time compensator generalized predictive controller; Gas compression systems; Model-predictive control; Regulatory control; Time-delays; Model predictive control; compression; flow modeling; gas flow; numerical model; operations technology; regulatory approach,,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Petrobras","The authors acknowledge Petrobras (Petr?leo Brasileiro S.

The real-time and bidi-rectional feature of data interaction guarantees its advantages of high accuracy, real-time performance and scalability. In this paper the digital twin technology was introduced to electric vehicle energy consumption research. First, an energy consumption model of an electric vehicle of BAIC BJEV was established, then the model was optimized and verified through the energy consumption data of the drum test. Based on the data of the vehicle real-time monitoring platform, a digital twin model was built, and it was trained and updated by daily new data. Eventually it can be used to predict and verify the data of vehicle. In this way the prediction of energy consumption of vehicles can be achieved. © 2021 by the authors.

Intelligent rapid-excavation technology is a requirement of safe and efficient coal production, and a fundamental way to solve the imbalance problem between mining and development. The problems of tough operating environment, complicated geological conditions, multiple construction procedures and poor safety are presented in the coal mine roadway development in China. Intelligent excavation mainly faces three problems, such as the insufficient completeness, reliability and ability of stand-alone excavation equipment, the limitation of surrounding rock control technology and the lack of the efficient coordination of excavation process and the intelligent collaboration technology for excavating equipment groups. In order to solve the problem of insufficient intelligent excavation support technology, five kinds of intelligent excavation support technologies are put forward: the reliability of excavating equipment, the online perception of roadway surrounding rock state, the aging control of roadway surrounding rock, the efficient cutting with low specific energy consumption, and the comprehensive control of excavating dust. Based on the integration technology of excavation, support and transportation, the basic architecture of intelligent excavation system with four dimensions of ""edge perception, platform decision, equipment execution and remote operation and maintenance"" is proposed. Five key intelligent excavation technologies, including integration of excavation and exploration, automatic cutting, intelligent support, excavating navigation and remote centralized control, are analyzed and discussed. In order to expand the coverage of core technology support of intelligent excavation, according to different excavating equipment and different conditions of coal seam, four kinds of intelligent excavation modes, including the integration of excavation, support and transportation, full-section roadheader, roadheader with two bolter and continuous miner with 5G, are proposed, which have been popularized and applied in China National Energy Group, China Coal Group, Shandong Energy Group and Shaanxi Coal Group. Finally, the development direction and suggestion of intelligent roadway excavation are put forward. It is suggested to study the new technology of underground space positioning and navigation, the dynamic monitoring of protection effect and the accurate adjustment of support process, the robot with integrated mining and bolting, the high-precision intelligent perception and digital twin of roadway face, and the platform of excavation system. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of China Coal Society.

Changes in daily routines created changes in water consumption patterns. Significant changes in water demands can affect the operation of water distribution systems, resulting in new patterns of flow, with implications for water age, pressure, and energy consumption. This research develops a digital twin to couple Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data with a hydraulic model to assess impacts on infrastructure due to changes in water demands associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for a case study. Using 2019 and COVID-19 modeling scenarios, the hydraulic model was executed to evaluate changes to water quality based on water age, pressure across nodes in the network, and the energy required by the system to distribute potable water. A water supply interruption event was modeled as a water main break to assess network resiliency for 2019 and COVID-19 demands. A digital twin provides the capabilities to explore and visualize emerging consumption patterns and their effects on the functioning of water systems, providing valuable analyses for water utility managers and insight for optimizing infrastructure operations and planning for long-term impacts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",COVID-19; Digital twin; Multi-modal failure; Resilience; Water demand; Water distribution systems,Advanced metering infrastructures; Energy utilization; Hydraulic models; Potable water; Water distribution systems; Water quality; Water supply; Consumption patterns; Coronavirus disease 2019; Coronaviruses; Daily routines; Multi-modal; Multi-modal failure; Resilience; Water ages; Water demand; Water infrastructure; Coronavirus,,,,,"King Abdulaziz University, KAU; Secretaría de Educación Superior, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación, SENESCYT; Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission, SACM","The authors would like to thank the City of Lakewood for collaborating on this project and providing information and data.

The sharp increase in changing customer demands has resulted in factories transitioning rapidly and yielding shorter product life cycles. Traditional modeling and simulation approaches are not suited to handle such scenarios. As a possible solution, we propose a generic data-driven framework for automated generation of simulation models as basis for digital twins for smart factories. The novelty of our proposed framework is in the data-driven approach that exploits advancements in machine learning and process mining techniques, as well as continuous model improvement and validation. The goal of the framework is to minimize and fully define, or even eliminate, the need for expert knowledge in the extraction of the corresponding simulation models. We illustrate our framework through a case study. © 2021 The Author(s)",Data-driven; Digital twin; Machine learning; Process mining; Reconfigurable manufacturing; Smart factory,Data mining; E-learning; Energy utilization; Life cycle; Manufacture; Real time systems; % reductions; Data driven; Energy-consumption; Increased productivity; Process mining; Real- time; Reconfigurable manufacturing; Simulation model; Smart factory; Smart manufacturing; Machine learning,,,,,,,,"Aheleroff, S., Xu, X., Zhong, R.Y., Lu, Y., Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) in Industry 4.0: an Architecture Reference Model (2021) Adv.

Responding to this interest partly involves addressing challenges related to building stock data collection and processing. The present study, carried out in conjunction with Natural Resources Canada's Canadian Energy End-use Mapping (CEE Map) project, aims to develop the inputs for housing energy modeling and mapping using property assessment data, building, heating permit data, and smart thermostat data. In this context, a systematic workflow is presented to extract useful information from various data sources to support housing energy simulations and municipal retrofit program planning. Permit data analysis supported refinement of housing data in Kelowna's urban digital twin. Results from building permit data analysis serve to update housing attributes including construction year and dwelling type. Results from heating permit analysis suggest that 17.5% of Kelowna dwellings could be potential candidates for heating system upgrades. Regarding thermostat setpoint temperature and occupancy for energy simulations, results obtained from smart thermostat data analysis were compared with EnerGuide Rating System (ERS) assumptions to investigate the potential improvements that can be made in energy simulation inputs. Comparative results indicated variations of up to 2 °C between smart thermostat data and EnerGuide assumptions for thermostat setpoint temperatures. Also, smart thermostat data suggests that 87% of dwellings were occupied for more than 50% of the time, whereas in ERS, occupancy is assumed to be 50%. Together, the overall data workflow and the detailed investigation of different datasets contributes to the development of a best practice methodology for housing energy modeling and mapping for municipalities in support of GHG emission reductions. Further, recommendations for permit data collection and scope for future research works are provided. © 2021",Building and heating permits; Energy mapping; Municipal housing retrofit program planning; Simulation inputs; Smart thermostat data; Systematic workflow,Data acquisition; Data handling; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Information analysis; Mapping; Retrofitting; Thermostats; Building and heating permit; Energy; Energy mapping; Municipal housing retrofit program planning; Program planning; Retrofit programs; Simulation input; Smart thermostat data; Systematic workflow; Work-flows; Housing,,,,,"3000702812; Canada Excellence Research Chairs, Government of Canada, CERC: CERC-2018-00005","The research reported in this study was supported by Natural Resources Canada's Innovation Fund and CanmetENERGY-Ottawa under contract number 3000702812 and the Canada Excellence Research Chairs Program (CERC-2018-00005), funded by the Tri-Agency Institutional Program Secretariat.

In particular, camera-based lane detection plays an essential role in autonomous vehicle trajectory planning. However, lane detection is subject to high complexity, and it is sensitive to illumination variation, appearance, and age of lane marking. In addition, the sheer infinite number of test cases for highly automated vehicles requires an increasing portion of test and validation to be performed in simulation and X-in-the-loop testing. To model the complexity of camera-based lane detection, physical models are often used, which consider the optical properties of the imager as well as image processing itself. This complexity results in high efforts for the simulation in terms of modelling as well as computational costs. This paper presents a Phenomenological Lane Detection Model (PLDM) to simulate camera performance. The innovation of the approach is the modelling technique using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is a class of Neural Network (NN). In order to prepare input data for our neural network model, massive driving tests have been performed on the M86 highway road in Hungary. The model’s inputs include vehicle dynamics signals (such as speed and acceleration, etc.). In addition, the difference between the reference output from the digital-twin map of the highway and camera lane detection results is considered as the target of the NN. The network consists of four hidden layers, and scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation is used for training the network. The results demonstrate that PLDM can sufficiently replicate camera detection performance in the simulation. The modelling approach improves the realism of camera sensor simulation as well as computational effort for X-in-the-loop applications and thereby supports safety validation of camera-based functionality in automated driving, which decreases the energy consumption of vehicles. © 2021 by the authors.

This research paper analyzes the potential benefit of a novel three-phase dual system power inverter over the conventional inverter used in a solar power plant. The concept of such a power inverter is explained, and the digital twin model is created in a MATLAB Simulink environment. The efficiency characteristic of the simulated inverter is compared to the efficiency characteristic of a real conventional inverter. A standalone data logging system and an additional data acquisition system were used to collect and process data from the real inverter. Comparison of the digital twin inverter and the real conventional inverter shows the potential benefit of this novel inverter technology. It is shown that the novel inverter can operate in a wider range of DC input power. The potential economic benefit is also presented and discussed in the paper. © 2021 by the authors.

The existing approaches related to digital twins of AM mainly focus on the process, machine, and factory levels to monitor and optimize the process and system performance of AM. This study aims at the machine level and adopts augmented reality (AR) to develop a digital twin for a material extrusion printer. To provide a digital representation of the printing process of a component, this study has proposed an approach using cumulated small cylinders to approximate the geometry of the component, which is called “Volume Approximation by Cumulated Cylinders (VACCY)”. To monitor the economic and environmental performance, this study has modeled four process indicators (electricity use, manufacturing cost, greenhouse gas emission, and primary energy consumption) and integrated them in the AR-based digital twin. Through the test of the developed digital twin for printing three components, the feasibility and performance of the developed digital twin are well demonstrated. © 2021 The Authors",Additive manufacturing; Augmented reality; Digital twin; Material extrusion; Process monitoring,Additives; Cylinders (shapes); Energy utilization; Environmental management; Extrusion; Greenhouse gases; Printing presses; Process control; Process monitoring; Digital modeling; Economic and environmental performance; Machine level; Material extrusion; Model-based OPC; Physical systems; Process factory; Process machine; Process performance; Systems performance; 3D printers,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: 252408385- IRTG 2057",This study is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG German Research Foundation)- 252408385- IRTG 2057 .,,"Stark, R., Damerau, T., Digital twin (2014) Modelling in Cutting, pp. 1-8. , P.J.

In this paper, a data-driven connected corridor traffic simulation model, i.e., a digital twin, is developed that leverages real-time data streams to model the current traffic state and provide dynamic feedback on traffic and environmental performance measures, e.g., travel time, speed, energy consumption, and vehicular emissions. The developed digital twin model architecture uses real-time 6-min volume aggregate data and 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz signal indication data as input to simulate the connected corridor using a traffic modeling software microscopic simulation. Dynamic data retrieval and transfer from the simulation model are enabled using the software's COM feature and a Flask web server. The robustness and feasibility of the digital twin architecture and the generated performance measure reasonableness are demonstrated on a smart corridor test bed. Such a model can be used to monitor and provide insights on the impacts of intelligent transportation system technologies on connected corridor traffic and environmental performance. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Connected corridors; Digital twin; Intelligent transportation system (ITS); Real-time simulation; Smart city; Traffic simulation,Computer software; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Memory architecture; Smart city; Traffic control; Travel time; Connected corridor; Data driven; Environmental performance; Intelligent transportation system; Intelligent transportation systems; Performance measure; Realtime simulation (RTS); Simulation model; Traffic performance; Traffic simulations; Intelligent systems; computer simulation; data set; intelligent transportation system; numerical model; real time; smart city; traffic management; Varanidae,,,,,FC-9930,"The information, data, or work presented herein was funded in part by the City of Atlanta (CoA) and in part by the National Center for Sustainable Transportation (NCST) Dissertation Grant.

In this paper, we addressed the critical challenges of DT construction and DT-assisted resource scheduling such as low accuracy, large iteration delay, and security threat. We propose a federated learning-based DT framework and present a Secure and lAtency-aware dIgital twin assisted resource scheduliNg algoriThm (SAINT). SAINT achieves low-latency, accurate, and secure DT by jointly optimizing the total iteration delay and loss function of DT, and leveraging abnormal model recognition (AMR). SAINT enables intelligent resource scheduling by using DT to improve the learning performance of deep Q-learning (DQN). SAINT supports access priority and energy consumption awareness due to the consideration of long-term constraints. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, SAINT has superior performance in cumulative iteration delay, DT loss function, energy consumption, and access priority deficit.

Conceptually, a Digital Twin is a digital replica of a physical entity in the real world, and this technology is leveraged in this study to design a cooperative driving system at non-signalized intersections, allowing connected vehicles to cooperate with each other to cross intersections without any full stops. Within the proposed Digital Twin framework, an enhanced first-in-first-out slot reservation algorithm is proposed to schedule the sequence of crossing vehicles, a consensus motion control algorithm is proposed to calculate vehicles' referenced longitudinal motion, and a model-based motion estimation algorithm to tackle realistic issues of the vehicular communication, such as communication delay and packet loss. Additionally, an augmented reality human-machine-interface is designed to provide the guidance to the driver to cooperate with other connected vehicles, and an agent-based modeling and simulation of the proposed system is conducted in Unity game engine based on a real-world map in San Francisco. The human-in-the-loop simulation results prove the benefits of the proposed algorithms with 20% reduction in travel time and 23.7% reduction in energy consumption, respectively, when compared with traditional signalized intersections.

In practice, DSM is utilized to change the pattern of electrical energy consumed by end-users to modify the load profile by manipulating the price of the electricity. This study focuses on the energy consumption consumed by students who are paying electricity bills indirectly. Therefore, the effectiveness of conventional DSM methods on this user requires further investigation. In this study, the FIS estimates the synthetic load profile based on the student's behavior profile. Then, three DSM techniques: load clipping, load shifting, and load conservation, are applied to the electrical usage behavior model. The FIS estimates the synthetic load profile based on the modified electrical usage behavior model with these DSM techniques. From this estimation, the synthetic load profiles are analyzed and compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the DSM methods on the students. The result shows that the FIS estimates the synthetic load profile satisfactorily. Also, load conservation is the most effective technique in reducing the peak load profile and power consumption for this type of user. Conclusively, the result implies that the proposed methodology can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the DSM method to reshape the load profile. © TÜBİTAK",Demand side management; Digital twin; Fuzzy inference system; Smart grid; Synthetic load profile,Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Students; Behavior model; Electrical energy; Electricity bill; Fuzzy inference systems; Load profiles; Load shifting; Peak load; Student behavior; Demand side management,,,,,"Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, KPM: H405; Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, UTHM","The authors would like to thank Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), Johor and Ministry of Education (MOE), Malaysia for the award of the grant that enabled this research under the grant No. H405.",,"Brosinsky, C, Song, X, Westermann, D., Digital twin concept of a continuously adaptive power system mirror (2019) International ETG-Congress 2019, ETG Symposium, pp. 1-20. , New York, NY, USA; Gaur, G, Mehta, N, Khanna, R, Kaur, S., Demand side management in a smart grid environment (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid and Smart Cities, pp. 227-231. , Singapore; Anjana, SP., Intelligent demand side management for residential users in a smart micro-grid (2017) 2017 International Conference on Technological Advancements in Power and Energy, pp. 1-5. , Kollam, India; Ma, K, Yao, T, Yang, J, Guan, X., Electrical power and energy systems residential power scheduling for demand response in smart grid (2016) International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy System, 78, pp. 320-325; (2008) Efficient Management of Electrical Energy Regulations 2008, , Energy Commission of Malaysia.

This paper presents the design methodology, mathematical analysis, simulation study, and experimental validation of a digital twin approach for fault diagnosis. We develop a digital twin that estimates the measurable characteristic outputs of a PV energy conversion unit (PVECU) in real time. The PVECU constitutes a PV source and a source-level power converter. The fault diagnosis is performed by generating and evaluating an error residual vector, which is the difference between the estimated and measured outputs. A PV panel-level power converter prototype is built to demonstrate how the sensing, processing, and actuation capabilities of the converter can enable effective fault diagnosis in real time. The experimental results show detection and identification of ten different faults in the PVECU. The time to fault detection (FD) in the power converter and the electrical sensors is less than 290 μs and the identification time is less than 4 ms. The time to FD and identification in the PV panel are less than 80 ms and 1.2 s, respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates higher fault sensitivity than that of existing approaches. It can diagnose a 20% drift in the electrical sensor gains and a 20% shading of a solar cell in the PV panel. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Converters; estimation; fault diagnosis; fault location; solar power generation,Electric fault location; Estimation; Failure analysis; Finite difference method; Photovoltaic cells; Power converters; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Torque converters; Actuation capability; Building applications; Building integrated; Design Methodology; Detection and identifications; Experimental validations; Mathematical analysis; Photovoltaic systems; Fault detection,,,,,"National Sleep Foundation, NSF","Manuscript received October 26, 2018; revised February 6, 2019; accepted March 31, 2019.

Focusing on the built environment, the voluntary adoption of rating systems for sustainability assessment is growing, with an increasing market value, and is perceived as a social responsibility both by public administration and by private companies. This paper proposes a framework for shifting from a static sustainability assessment to a digital twin (DT)-based and Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled dynamic approach. This new approach allows for a real-time evaluation and control of a wide range of sustainability criteria with a usercentered point of view. A pilot building, namely, the eLUX lab cognitive building in the University of Brescia, was used to test the framework with some sample applications. The educational building accommodates the daily activities of the engineering students by constantly interacting with the sensorized asset monitoring indoor comfort and air quality conditions as well as the energy behavior of the building in order to optimize the trade-off with renewable energy production. The framework is the cornerstone of a methodology exploiting the digital twin approach to support the decision processes related to sustainability through the whole building’s life cycle. © 2021 by the authors.

Presently, its elaboration is driven primarily by cost reduction. Growth will, however, be fuelled by the consumption of various resources, bringing with it unavoidable losses and environmental, economic, and societal impacts. Additionally, strong deployment growth will be trailed by waste growth, which needs to be managed, to support Sustainable Development and Circular Economy (CE). A rigorous approach to quantifying the resource efficiency, circularity and sustainability of complex PV life cycles, and exploring opportunities for partially sustaining industry growth through the recovery of high-quality secondary resources is needed. We create a high-detail digital twin of a Silicon PV life cycle using process simulation. The scalable, predictive simulation model accounts for the system's non-linearities by incorporating the physical and thermochemical principles that govern processes down to the unit operation level. Neural network-based surrogate functions are subsequently used to analyse the system's response to variations in end-of-life and kerf recycling in terms of primary resource and power consumption, PV power generation capacity, and CO2 emission. Applying the second law of thermodynamics, opportunities for improving the sustainability of unit operations, the larger processes they are the building blocks of, and the system as a whole are pinpointed, and the technical limits of circularity highlighted. We show the significant effects changes in technology can have on the conclusions drawn from such analyses. © 2021",Circular Economy; Digital twin simulation; Exergy; Neural networks; Silicon photovoltaics,Cost reduction; Digital twin; Economic and social effects; Predictive analytics; Secondary recovery; Silicon; Sustainable development; Thermodynamics; Environmental footprints; Photovoltaic industry; Predictive simulation modeling; Process simulations; PV power generation; Resource efficiencies; Second Law of Thermodynamics; Silicon photovoltaic; Solar power generation; silicon; artificial neural network; carbon emission; computer simulation; ecological footprint; environmental economics; exergy; numerical model; photovoltaic system; power generation; silicon; sustainability; Article; artificial neural network; carbon footprint; energy consumption; energy cost; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; life cycle assessment; physical chemistry; process design; thermal analysis; thermodynamics,,"silicon, 7440-21-3",,,,,,"Abadías Llamas, A., Valero Delgado, A., Valero Capilla, A., Torres Cuadra, C., Hultgren, M., Peltomäki, M., Roine, A., Reuter, M.A., Simulation-based exergy, thermo-economic and environmental footprint analysis of primary copper production (2019) Miner.

APV systems symbiotically cohabitate power-generation facilities and agricultural production systems. In this work, solar power flow is rapidly computed with a reduced order model of Maxwell’s equations, based on a high-frequency decomposition of the irradiance into multiple rays, which are propagated forward in time to ascertain multiple reflections and absorption for various source-system configurations, varying multi-panel inclination, panel refractive indices, sizes, shapes, heights, ground refractive properties, etc. The method allows for a solar installation to be tested from multiple source directions quickly and uses a genomic-based Machine-Learning Algorithm to optimize the system. This is particularly useful for planning of complex next-generation solar farm systems involving bifacial (double-sided) panelling, which are capable of capturing ground albedo reflection, exemplified by APV systems. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results, with the overall goal being to provide a computational framework to rapidly design and deploy complex APV systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Agrophotovoltaics; Digital-twin; Machine-learning,Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Digital twin; E-learning; Electric load flow; Learning algorithms; Maxwell equations; Refractive index; Solar power plants; Agricultural production system; Computational framework; High frequency HF; Multi objective; Multiple reflections; Reduced order models; Refractive properties; Solar installation; Machine learning,,,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA: 2020-67021-32855","This work has been partially supported by the UC Berkeley College of Engineering and the USDA AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS), USDA award number 2020-67021-32855.",,"https://www.energy.gov/science-innovation/energy-sources/renewable-energy/solar; Goetzberger, A., Zastrow, A., On the coexistence of solar-energy conversion and plant cultivation (1982) Int J Solar Energy, 1 (1), pp. 55-69; Harshavardhan, D., Pearce Joshua, M., The potential of agrivoltaic systems (2016) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 54, pp. 299-308; Dupraz, C., Marrou, H., Talbot, G., Dufour, L., Nogier, A., Ferard, Y., Combining solar photovoltaic panels and food crops for optimizing land use: towards new agrivoltaic schemes (2011) Renew Energy, 36, pp. 2725-2732; Liu, W., Liu, L., Guan, G., Zhang, F., Li, M., Lv, H., Yao, P., Ingenhoff, J., A novel agricultural photovoltaic system based on solar spectrum separation (2018) Solar energy, 162, pp. 84-94. , (,),.

In this paper, an ultra-short-term prediction mechanism of photovoltaic power generation based on digital twin is proposed. By constructing digital twins, the real-time and high-precision photovoltaic power prediction is carried out. Firstly, a virtual model of photovoltaic power prediction is established based on the GA-BP neural network, and the twin data of the photovoltaic cells and the surrounding environment are collected with the multi-dimensional sensors, and the historical database is updated. Then, based on the collected twin data, the preliminary prediction results are obtained. Finally, through the similar weather condition searching, the actual power value and the predicted power values at those times under the similar conditions are found, and then the preliminary prediction results are modified to obtain the final predicted power. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively improve the ultra-short-term prediction accuracy of the photovoltaic power output. © 2021, Power System Technology Press.

The hydropower industry is turning to this technology with high expectations of obtaining high quality data to validate and calibrate numerical models that could be used as digital twins of key assets, further strengthening the sector’s relevant position within industry 4.0. Prior to any validation, fiber Bragg grating sensors’ ability to perform well underwater for long periods of time with minimal degradation, and their ease of scalability, drew the authors´ attention. A simplified modal analysis of a partially submerged beam is proposed here as a first step to validate the potential of this type of technology for hydropower applications. Fiber Bragg grating sensors are used to obtain the beam’s natural frequencies and to damp vibrations under different conditions. The results are compared with more established waterproof electric strain gauges and a laser vibrometer with good agreement. The presence of several sensors in a single fiber ensures high spatial resolution, fundamental to precisely determine vibration patterns, which is a main concern in this industry. In this work, the beam’s vibration patterns have been successfully captured under different excitations and conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

The exponential increase in the complexity of next‐generation wind turbines requires artificial intelligence (AI) to operate the machines efficiently and consistently. Evolving the current Industry 4.0 digital twin technology beyond a sole aid for the human decision‐making process, the digital twin in the proposed system is used for highly effective training of the AI through machine learning. Human intelligence (HI) is elevated to a supervisory level, in which high‐level decisions made through a human–machine interface break the autonomy, when needed.

The paper discusses the advantages of using digital twins in the development of control systems and operation of distributed heat and electric power generation facilities. The possibilities of using the digital doubles for increasing the efficiency of the considered objects is presented as the example of optimizing the configuration of a control system of solar collectors in the presence of heat losses in pipelines of the external circuit. Further, the total balance consumed and generated electric and heat energy are presented. Examples of algorithms for protecting equipment to improve security are given, and the possibilities of improving the reliability of distributed power systems are considered. The system use of the digital twins provides the possibility of developing and debugging control algorithms, which increase the efficiency, reliability and safety of control objects, including distributed thermal and electrical power generation complexes. © 2021 Polish Academy of Sciences.

Alongside efforts to offer optimum solutions through plant design and sizing, it is also necessary to develop a flexible virtualised replica of renewable hydrogen plants, that not only models compatibility with the “plug-and-play” nature of many facilities, but that also identifies key elements for optimisation of system operation. This study presents a model for a renewable hydrogen production plant based on real-time historical and present-day datasets of PV connected to a virtualised grid-connected AC microgrid comprising different technologies of batteries, electrolysers, and fuel cells. Mathematical models for each technology were developed from chemical and physical metrics of the plant. The virtualised replica is the first step toward the implementation of a digital twin of the system, and accurate validation of the system behaviour when updated with real-time data. As a case study, a solar hydrogen pilot plant consisting of a 60 kW Solar PV, a 40 kW PEM electrolyser, a 15 kW LIB battery and a 5 kW PEM fuel cell were simulated and analysed. Two effective operational factors on the plant's performance are defined: (i) electrolyser power settings to determine appropriate hydrogen production over twilight periods and/or overnight and (ii) a user-defined minimum threshold for battery state of charge to prevent charge depletion overnight if the electrolyser load is higher than its capacity. The objective of this modelling is to maximise hydrogen yield while both loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and microgrid excess power are minimised. This analysis determined: (i) a hydrogen yield of 38–39% from solar DC energy to hydrogen energy produced, (ii) an LPSP &lt;2.6 × 10−4 and (iii) &lt; 2% renewable energy lost to the grid as excess electricity for the case study. © 2021 The Author(s)",Analytical model; Operational aspect; Renewable hydrogen; Replica simulation,Analytical models; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Pilot plants; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solar power generation; Case-studies; Electrolysers; Hydrogen plants; Hydrogen yields; Loss of power supply probability; Microgrid; Operational aspects; Renewable hydrogens; Replica simulation; Solar hydrogen; Hydrogen production,,,,,"2018/RND012; Queensland University of Technology, QUT; Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA","This activity received funding from Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) as part of ARENA's Research and Development Program - Renewable Hydrogen for Export (Contract No. 2018/RND012 ).

In reality, it is a decentralized wind power generation mode based on clean energy to replace the centralized large-scale traditional energy. In order to reduce computational complexity of massive DFIGs group in large power grid simulation, decentralized algorithm and architecture used in High-Performance Computing (HPC) are proposed and verified in this paper, which can batch automatic allocation of models to different computing units for parallel computing, and the fine-grained decoupling distributed parallel calculation method can effectively solve the exponential explosion of computing dimensions. The result waveforms under steady-state and three-phase fault transient conditions are basically consistent, which can meet the requirements of calculation accuracy, and also verified the efficiency of paper's work. © 2021 The Author",DFIG wind; Digital twin technology; Ecological Marxism; High performance computing technology,Cluster computing; Ecology; Electric fault currents; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Wind power; Centralised; DFIG wind; Digital twin technology; Doubly fed induction generators; Ecological marxism; High-performance computing technology; Large-scales; Marxisms; Performance computing; Technical models; Asynchronous generators,,,,,"19BKS009; Beijing Foreign Studies University, BFSU; Beijing Social Science Fund: 16KDC028; China Electric Power Research Institute, CEPRI","The research was supported by China National Social Science Fund Project ?Research on Ecological Thought in Capital from the Perspective of Life Community?

In the electric sector, power plants seek to adapt these new concepts to optimize electric power generation processes, as well as to reduce operating costs and unscheduled downtime intervals. In these plants, PID control strategies are commonly used in water cooling systems, which use fans to perform the thermal exchange between water and the ambient air. However, as the nonlinearities of these systems affect the performance of the drivers, sometimes a greater number of fans than necessary are activated to ensure water temperature control which, consequently, increases energy expenditure. In this work, our objective is to develop digital twins for a water cooling system with auxiliary equipment, in terms of the decision making of the operator, to determine the correct number of fans. This model was developed based on the algorithm of automatic extraction of fuzzy rules, derived from the SCADA of a power plant located in the capital of Paraíba, Brazil. The digital twins can update the fuzzy rules in the case of new events, such as steady-state operation, starting and stopping ramps, and instability. The results from experimental tests using data from 11 h of plant operations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed digital twin model. Furthermore, in all scenarios, the average percentage error was less than 5% and the average absolute temperature error was below 3◦C. © 2021 by the authors.

The gradual depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution issues require new renewable and eco-friendly power generation methods such as wave power plants. However, in wave power generation, which generates electricity by the energy of waves, it is criti-cal to understand and predict the amount of power generation and operational efficiency factors such as breakdown because these are closely related to highly variable wave ener-gy. Therefore, firstly, it is necessary to derive a meaningful correlation between highly volatile data such as wave height and sensor data in oscillating water column (OWC) chamber. Secondly, methodological study that can predict desired information should be conducted by learning the prediction situation with the extracted data based on the derived correlation. In this study, we design a workflow-based training model using a machine learning framework to predict the pressure of the OWC and verify the validity of pressure prediction analysis through the verification and evaluation dataset, using Internet of Things sensor data to enable smart operation and maintenance with the digital twin of the wave generation system. © 2021 ICIC International.",Big data; Machine learning; OWC; Pressure prediction model; Wave energy converter,,,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP: IITP-2020-0-01791; Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, KISTI","This research was supported by KISTI (Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information), and the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), the AI Grand ICT Research Center support program (IITP-2020-0-01791) supervised by the IITP (In-stitute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).","Acknowledgment.

Owing to the highly volatile nature of wave energy, the application of prediction techniques for power generation, failure diagnosis, and operational efficiency plays a key role in the successful operation of wave power plants (WPPs). To this end, we propose the following approaches: (i) deriving the correlation between highly volatile data such as wave height data and sensor data in an oscillating water column (OWC) chamber; (ii) development of an optimal training model capable of accurate prediction of the state of the wave energy converter (WEC) based on the collected sensor data. In this study, we developed a big data analysis system that can utilize the machine learning framework in KNIME (an open analysis platform), and to enable smart operation, we designed a training model using a digital twin of an OWC–WEC that is currently in operation.

The methodology was based on digitalization analysis and numerical modeling as a preliminary stage. A mathematical model of the PV pumping installation considered the determi-nation of the characteristic equations for all its components. These have been used together with the SISIFO simulation software to achieve the performances of the mechanical and electrical components of an advanced PV pumping system. Its global performance features, namely the monthly energy yield, monthly pumping yield, and monthly total performances (energy and flow rate) were introduced. Digital platform (DP) for PV systems characterized by three advanced technolo-gies—machine learning (ML), digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) was developed. The simulation results were discussed for a specific case study conducted for a location in the Southern Romania regarding the irrigation potential, taking into account the main meteorological parame-ters: solar irradiance and ambient temperature, related to the site. The AI approach was imple-mented to achieve an optimum operation of the PV pumping system by the use of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method and the MATLAB/Simulink software. A unified development of all the components of the PV pumping system using the SISIFO simulation software was established by the authors, with major implications in the development of solar PV installations on large‐scale. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the construction industry has a poor record for delivering productivity and efficiency advancement. As proven in other industries, digital methods can shorten product development time and cost by reducing prototyping with the use of numerical simulation. Further, a digital twin is an extensive computational model of a product that is planned to improve over its lifecycle by leveraging operational data. This paper presents a coupled simulation for the thermal design of a heating and cooling system that is integrated with a lightweight roof structure. The concrete roof structure is shape optimised to provide a low embodied energy building element, which is thermally activated to supply space conditioning from a renewable geothermal source. This work is focused on the modelling methodology used by the energy domain to support the development of a digital twin for a multifunctional building element. High-resolution analysis is used to resolve building physics issues and to provide the initial system performance. A parametric geometry model is used to apply the hydronic pipework to a complex roof shape. With input from the previous two steps, a reduced resolution method is used to add the characteristics of the system to an industry standard whole building simulation model. This final step allows for the development of initial control strategies for the novel multifunctional element. The implications of the research findings are discussed in the context of possible alternations to the building design process due to the influence of digital fabrication. © 2019",Building simulation; Digital fabrication; Digital twin; Early integrated design; Improved lifecycle energy; Thermally activated building system (TABS),Architectural design; Building components; Construction industry; Geothermal energy; Life cycle; Numerical methods; Roof coverings; Building simulation; Building systems; Digital fabrication; Digital twin; Improved lifecycle energy; Integrated designs; Structural design,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Kommission für Technologie und Innovation, CTI; EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule ZÃ¼rich, ETH; National Centre of Competence in Research Robotics","D.

When used with a taut mooring, the anchor is typically subjected to a maintained load component and intermittent episodes of cyclic loading throughout the design life. These loads, and the associated shearing, remoulding and consolidation processes, cause changes in the anchor capacity, particularly in soft, fine-grained soils. The changing anchor capacity affects the mooring performance by changing the safety margin and also the overall system reliability. In this paper the changing anchor capacity in reconstituted, normally consolidated natural carbonate silt was assessed through a series of beam centrifuge tests on horizontally loaded circular plate anchors. The results demonstrate that full consolidation under a typical maintained load leads to a 50% gain in the anchor capacity, and subsequent cyclic loading and reconsolidation can triple this increase. An effective stress framework based on critical state concepts is employed to explain and support the experimental observations. This study shows that, when viewed from a whole-life reliability perspective, maintained and cyclic loading provide a long-term enhancement of anchor capacity in soft, fine-grained soils. This beneficial effect is currently overlooked in design practice, but can be predicted using the framework shown here, which can form the basis for a digital twin that monitors the through-life integrity of a plate anchor. © 2019",anchors & anchorages; bearing capacity; centrifuge modelling; consolidation; numerical modelling; offshore engineering; soil/structure interaction,Bearing capacity; Consolidation; Critical current density (superconductivity); Cyclic loads; Digital twin; Energy policy; Mooring; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Reliability; Beneficial effects; Consolidation process; Critical state concepts; Fine grained soil; Mooring performance; Offshore floating; Renewable energy projects; System reliability; Trenching; anchor; centrifugal model test; consolidation; cyclic loading; effective stress; mooring system; silt; soft soil,,,,,"Shell; Australian Research Council, ARC; University of Western Australia, UWA","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The first author acknowledges his research studentship support from the ARC Industrial Transformation Research Hub for Offshore Floating Facilities and the University of Western Australia.

In the domain of industrial energy systems, they are applied to facilitate a flexible and optimized operation. With the help of Digital Twins, the industry can participate even stronger in the ongoing renewable energy transition. Current Digital Twin implementations are often application-specific solutions without general architectural concepts and their structures and namings differ, although the basic concepts are quite similar. For this reason, we analyzed concepts, architectures, and frameworks for Digital Twins in the literature to develop a technology-independent Generic Digital Twin Architecture (GDTA), which is aligned with the information technology layers of the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0). This alignment facilitates a common naming and understanding of the proposed architectural structure. A proof-of-concept shows the application of Semantic Web technologies for instantiating the proposed GDTA for a use case of a Packed-Bed Thermal Energy Storage (PBTES). © 2020 by the authors.

Smart technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Twin (DT), etc. enable companies within the sector of renewable energies to drastically improve their operations. In this sectoral context, where upgraded sustainability standards also play a vital role, it is necessary to fulfil the human capital requirements of the imminent technological advances. This article aims to determine the current skills of the renewable energy industry workforce and to predict the upcoming skill requirements linked to a digital transition by creating a unified database that contains both types of skills. This will serve as a tool for renewable energy businesses, education centers, and policymakers to plan the training itinerary necessary to close the skills gap, as part of the sectoral strategy to achieve a competent future workforce. © 2021 by the authors.

District cooling reduces the environmental impact and promotes the use of renewable sources. Earlier studies to optimise the production plants of district cooling systems were focused primarily on plants with compressor chillers and thermal energy storage devices. Although absorption chillers are crucial for integrating renewable sources into these systems, very few studies have considered them from the cooling perspective. In this regard, this paper presents the progress and results of the implementation of a virtual testbed based on a digital twin of a district cooling production plant with both compressor and absorption chillers. The aim of this study, carried out within the framework of INDIGO, a European Union-funded project, was (i) to develop a reliable model that can be used in a model predictive controller and (ii) to simulate the plant using this controller. The production plant components, which included absorption and compressor chillers, as well as cooling towers, were built using the equation-based Modelica programming language, and were calibrated using information from the manufacturer, together with real operation data. The remainder of the plant was modelled in Python. To integrate the Modelica models into the Python environment, a combination of machine learning techniques and state-space representation models was used. With these techniques, models with a high computational speed were obtained, which were suitable for real-time applications. These models were then used to build a model predictive control for the production plant to minimise the primary energy usage. The improvements in the control and the resultant energy savings achieved were compared with a baseline case working on a standard cascade control. Energy savings up to 50% were obtained in the simulation-based experiments. © 2020",District cooling; Machine learning; Modelica; Modelling; MPC; Testbed,Cascade control systems; Compressors; Controllers; Cooling systems; Digital storage; Digital twin; District heating; Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Heat storage; High level languages; Learning systems; Model predictive control; Refrigerators; State space methods; Testbeds; Thermoelectric equipment; Absorption chillers; Computational speed; District cooling system; Machine learning techniques; Model predictive controllers; Primary energy usages; Real-time application; State space representation; Absorption cooling,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 696098; Horizon 2020","The work leading to this research paper was out within the framework of the Project INDIGO, which had received funding from European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under grant agreement n° 696098 .","The work leading to this research paper was out within the framework of the Project INDIGO, which had received funding from European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under grant agreement n? 696098.","IEA, Global status report for buildings and construction 2019 (2019); Tracking buildings (2019), Paris; The future of cooling.

A frequently used keyword in this context is digital twin. In this work, the term digital twin is defined with regard to a flexible air separation unit. Furthermore, the digital twin's core component, a highly detailed dynamic plant model, is presented. A pressure-driven approach is used as a basis for the modeling. The focus of this work is on the distillation columns. Therefore, a pressure-driven sieve tray column model is presented using design correlations for the calculation of pressure drop and both the liquid and vapor holdup. Furthermore, two industrially relevant load change scenarios are presented and discussed. A plant shutdown is simulated until a state of cold standby is reached. Then, starting from this state a cold restart is simulated. Cold standby means that the plant remains at cryogenic temperatures. Lastly, a hazard analysis is conducted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Air separation unit; Digital twin; Dynamic simulation; Flexible operation; Pressure-driven simulation; Renewable energies,Distillation columns; Separation; Air separation unit; Core components; Dynamics simulation; Flexible operation; Plant model; Pressure-driven; Pressure-driven simulation; Process industries; Renewable energies; Simulation approach; Plant shutdowns,,,,,"Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF: FKZ 03SFK3E1-2","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Kopernikus project SynErgie by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, FKZ 03SFK3E1-2) and the project supervision by the project management organization Projektträger Jülich (PtJ).",,"Amrit, R., Rawlings, J.B., Angeli, D., Economic optimization using model predictive control with a terminal cost (2011) Annu.

The purpose of the study is to formulate the content and key directions of learning processes based on modeling and the formation of digital twins for the production and consumption of goods. The research method is based on the analysis of structural links in socio-economic systems, where the potential of human capital is realized. The study describes a trialectic model for the system development mechanism, which gives grounds to distinguish three types of essential components of implementing the specialists competencies (material, information, and communication). Based on the concept of ""system of systems"", the necessity of multifunctional training of specialists for socio-economic systems is substantiated and shown on the list of personal knowledge/ skills in the renewable energy sector. Recent trends in the reproduction of human capital, such as intellectualization, increased communication, internationalization, acquisition of skills, customization, and communication with consumers, are stated in line with Industries 4.0 and 5.0. The potential for future research is aimed at harmonizing relations between humans and cyber-physical systems, motivating the needs for selfdevelopment, and using disruptive technologies in the reproduction of human capital. © 2021 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

The digital twin of the electrical grid is created via synchronization between the real-time simulator and the supervision, control and data acquisition system. The digital twin can be integrated to larger system with the addition of simulated devices, with or without reconfiguration of topology. The setup is then completed with power-hardware-in-the-loop interface where the real distributed energy resource can be physically integrated. The impact can then be analysed locally and globally as it propagates through the desired deployment environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Digital twin; Distributed renewable energy resources; Holistic testing; Power-hardware-in-the-loop; SCADA-as-a-service,Data acquisition; Digital devices; Digital integrated circuits; Digital twin; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Synthetic apertures; Control and data acquisition systems; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed renewable energy resources; Electrical grids; Integrated power; Power hardware in the loops; Real time simulators; Renewable energy resources,,,,,"654113, 870620",This work is supported by the European Community’s Horizon 2020 Program - under the project “ERIGrid” (Grant Agreement No. 654113) and ERIGrid II (Grant Agreement No. 870620).,,"Nguyen, V.H., (2017); van Der Meer, A.A., Cyber-physical energy systems modeling, test specification, and co-simulation based testing (2017) Workshop on Modeling and Simulation of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems, , .

The emergence of information technologies such as Digital Twins (DT) in the field of the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 allows a substantial development in automatic diagnostic systems. The objective of this work is to obtain the DT of a Photo-voltaic Solar Farm (PVSF) with a deep-learning (DL) approach. To build such a DT, sensor-based time series are properly analyzed and processed. The resulting data are used to train a DL model (e.g., autoencoders) in order to detect anomalies of the physical system in its DT. Results show a reconstruction error around 0.1, a recall score of 0.92 and an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.97. There-fore, this paper demonstrates that the DT can reproduce the behavior as well as detect efficiently anomalies of the physical system. © 2021 by the authors.

The load balancing algorithm of the digital twin server cluster significantly impacts the computing performance of the computing nodes. Optimal complete matching of a weighted bipartite graph is proposed to allocate computing task blocks to each computing node evenly. In the proposed algorithm, the computation times of simulation computing task blocks are estimated and the computation time of one single step in the task blocks are used as dynamic load indicators of the computing nodes. The indices are fed back to the scheduling server in real time. With the total steps of the simulation computing task blocks and the computation time of each single step for the task blocks, a fully weighted bipartite graph of computing nodes and simulation computing task blocks is constructed, greedy expansion of the Hungarian algorithm is used to optimize the complete matching of this weighted bipartite graph. Based on the optimization results, the task blocks are allocated to the computing nodes correspondingly in real time. Simulation-driven model parameter correction function, the representative simulation computing applications of digital twin for multi-energy system was used to test the proposed algorithm and the results show a significant improvement of the load balancing effect at the computing nodes. © 2021 The Authors",Digital twin; Load balancing; Simulation computing task blocks; Weighted bipartite graph,Cluster computing; Clustering algorithms; Dynamic loads; Renewable energy resources; Computation time; Computing nodes; Computing-task; Load-Balancing; Matchings; Multi-energy systems; Power; Simulation computing; Simulation computing task block; Single-step; Graph theory,,,,,"China Southern Power Grid, CSG",The above work is partly supported by the key technological project (No. 067600KK52190010 ) of China Southern Power Grid .,,"Teng, Y., Liu, S., Hui, Q., Chen, Z., Integrated demand side response model considering collaborative optimization of regional multi-energy system clusters (2020) Proc CSEE, 40 (22), pp. 7282-7294; Deng, X., Jiang, Z., Sundaresh, L., Yao, W., Yu, W., Wang, W., A time-domain electromechanical co-simulation framework for power system transient analysis with retainment of user defined models (2020) Int J Electr Power Energy Syst; Deng, X., Bian, D., Wang, W., Jiang, Z., Yao, W., Qiu, W., Deep learning model to detect various synchrophasor data anomalies (2020) IET Gener Transm Dist; Deng, X., Bian, D., Shi, D., Yao, W., Wu, L., Liu, Y., Impact of low data quality on disturbance triangulation application using high-density PMU measurements (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 105054-105061; Shen, C., Jia, M., Chen, Y., Huang, S., Xiang, Y., Digital twin of the energy internet and its application (2020) J Glob Energy Interconnect, 3 (1), pp. 1-13; Shao, C., Wang, X., Wang, X., Probe into analysis and planning of multi-energy systems (2016) Proc CSEE, 36 (14); Li, J., Nie, Y., , pp. 2387-2391. , Zhou, A dynamic load balancing algorithm based on consistent hash.

Off-grid water filtration plants are an alternative for communities where transportation of freshwater becomes a real challenge due to a lack of infrastructure for the water potabilization processes. For such potable water filtration plants, hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) can be a viable solution to meet their energy demand meanwhile providing a sustainable water solution. The main contribution of this work is the unique methodology, which starts with a sizing procedure of various hybrid energy systems using a commercial software “Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER)” and spreadsheet algorithms, followed by a “Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)” based multiobjective optimization. Single-objective optimization scenarios contain photovoltaic installation capacity, wind turbines, diesel generators, and battery energy storage systems including Pb-acid (Lead-acid), Li-ion (Lithium-ion), and AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) technologies as design variables to maximize the cost of electricity or net-present-cost. Multiobjective optimization also involved environmental (CO2 emissions i.e. carbon dioxide emissions) and water cost indices as an additional packet to single-objective optimization scenarios. Afterward, a multicriteria decision-making tool using “The Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” is applied on the Pareto front to attain the final optimization results. The analysis is further explored in depth by generating digital twins (surrogate or meta model) of HRES data using artificial intelligence techniques (artificial neural network and group-method-of-data-handling). Furthermore, calculus and statistical sensitivity analysis assist in the identification of the significant variables in the design procedure. In summary, the technical contribution of this work can be divided into two sections. The first one is the design of a hybrid energy system for the water management of an isolated community of the indigenous Mayan region of Yucatan, Mexico, which has never been considered before. Secondly, the technical contribution is related to the usage of environmental emissions as an objective function, which is not considered in the traditional design of hybrid energy systems by the software HOMER. Environmental emission as an objective function is not considered while designing a hybrid energy system in commerical softwares like HOMER, in fact, HOMER provides a list of environmental impacts but it is a secondary outcome as a result of technoeconomic optimization. Analysis of results between HOMER pro and spreadsheet has shown conformity, reporting that the optimal case consists of a photovoltaic system, diesel generator, and Li-ion technology of battery storage with capacities of ∼17 kW, ∼5kW, and 44–48 kWh, respectively, corresponding to a net present cost ranging from 70,000 United States Dollars (USD) to 79,000 USD and a cost of electricity ranging from 0.205 to 0.229 USD/kWh. The achievements obtained with multiobjective optimization indicate that the cost of electricity and net present cost can be further reduced by 0.86 % and 0.73 %, respectively, at a decrement of only 0.4% of the renewable fraction as compared to the single objective optimization scenario. It is concluded that multiobjective optimization provides an add-in feature to HOMER by using environmental emissions as an objective function. The design procedure and adapted methodology can be useful to promote sustainable development in the statewide context and can provide a scientific justification to national energy policymakers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Digital twin; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Optimization; Potable water filtration; Sensitivity analysis; Wastewater treatment; Water-energy nexus,Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Data handling; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Lithium-ion batteries; Neural networks; Potable water; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water filtration; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid optimization; Hybrid renewable energies; Hybrid renewable energy system; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Potable water filtration; Single objective optimization; Water energy; Water-energy nexus; Multiobjective optimization; alternative energy; artificial intelligence; computer simulation; drinking water; genetic algorithm; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis; wastewater treatment; water management; water planning; Mexico [North America]; Yucatan,,,,,"Facultad de Química, Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT; Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán, UADY: 1006703, 1007727, 752330, 752354, 784785, 784880, 861995, 949314","The authors, Rasikh Tariq, A.J.

But, to ensure fulfillment of contracts under these circumstances, a vast number of possible scenarios, incorporating uncertain supply and demand, has to be simulated ahead of time. This many-query gas network simulation task can be accelerated by model reduction, yet, large-scale, nonlinear, parametric, hyperbolic partial differential(-algebraic) equation systems, modeling natural gas transport, are a challenging application for model order reduction algorithms. For this industrial application, we bring together the scientific computing topics of: mathematical modeling of gas transport networks, numerical simulation of hyperbolic partial differential equation, and parametric model reduction for nonlinear systems. This research resulted in the morgen (Model Order Reduction for Gas and Energy Networks) software platform, which enables modular testing of various combinations of models, solvers, and model reduction methods. In this work we present the theoretical background on systemic modeling and structured, data-driven, system-theoretic model reduction for gas networks, as well as the implementation of morgen and associated numerical experiments testing model reduction adapted to gas network models. © 2021, The Author(s).",Digital twin; Empirical Gramians; Gas network; Hyperbolic systems; Model reduction,Economics; Nonlinear equations; Parameter estimation; Renewable energy resources; Software testing; Well testing; Hyperbolic partial differential equation; Model order reduction; Model reduction method; Natural gas transport; Numerical experiments; Parametric modeling; Partial differential; Renewable energy source; Gases,,,,,"0324019B; National Science Foundation, NSF: DMS-1439786; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWi","This work is supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, in the joint project: “MathEnergy – Mathematical Key Technologies for Evolving Energy Grids”, sub-project: Model Order Reduction (Grant number: 0324019B), and by the National Science Foundation under Grant number: DMS-1439786 while the author was in residence at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics in Providence, RI, during the “Model and dimension reduction in uncertain and dynamic systems” program.

Instantaneous response to critical situations is essential for the integration of renewable energies. The most widely used standards for clock synchronisation, such as Network Time Protocol (NTP) and Precision Time Protocol (PTP), do not allow for achieving synchronised simultaneous sampling in distributed systems. In this work, a novel distributed synchronism system based on the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standard has been validated for its integration in an architecture oriented towards the high-resolution digitisation of photovoltaic (PV) generation systems. This method guarantees a time stamping with an optimal resolution that allows for the analysis of the influence of fast-evolving atmospheric fluctuations in several plants located in the same geographical area. This paper proposes an enhanced micro-phasor measurement unit (µPMU) that acts as a phasor meter and TSN master controlling the monitoring system synchronism. With this technique, the synchronism would be extended to the remaining measurement systems that would be involved in the installation at distances greater than 100 m. Several analyses were carried out with an on-line topology of four acquisition systems capturing simultaneously. The influence of the Ethernet network and the transducers involved in the acquisition process were studied. Tests were performed with Ethernet cable lengths of 2, 10, 50, and 75 m. The results were validated with 24-bit Sigma-Delta converters and high-precision resistor networks specialised in high-voltage monitoring. It was observed that with an appropriate choice of sensors and TSN synchronism, phase errors of less than ±1µs can be guaranteed by performing distributed captures up to 50 kS/s. Statistical analysis showed that uncertainties of less than ±100 ns were achieved with 16-bit Successive Approximation Register (SAR) converters at a moderate cost. Finally, the requirements of the IEEE C37.118.1-2011 standard for phasor measurement units (PMU) were also satisfied. This standard establishes an uncertainty of ±3.1 µs for 50 Hz systems. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a simultaneous sampling system for distributed acquisition systems coordinated by a µPMU. © 2021 by the authors.

It is well-known that the interconnection of power electronic converters can be a source of instabilities. Traditionally, impedance-based stability analyses are performed using either the analytical description or the identification of the output impedance of the source converter and the input admittance of the load converter. However, this methodology is restricted by the small-signal conditions, which are usually violated in this kind of systems due to the high variability imposed by the renewable energy sources. In nonlinear systems, the stability analysis usually consists on the definition of the region of attraction around a stable equilibrium point. In the literature, the analysis of nonlinear systems is almost exclusively applied to analytical systems, where all the details are known. This paper proposes a black-box methodology to obtain the region of attraction of the equilibrium point of commercial off-the-shelf dc-dc converters working in power distribution systems. First, optimization algorithms are used to identify the parameters of a predefined structure, such that it is able to reproduce the dynamic behavior of the system. The parameters identified can be used to create a switching equivalent model that accounts for the nonlinearities produced by the switching process of the converters. Second, the bisection method is implemented to minimize the number of simulations needed to determine the region of stability accurately. The proposed methodology has been validated both with simulations and with an experimental setup. © 2013 IEEE.",Bisection method; black-box models; digital twin; GAPSO algorithm; nonlinear systems; optimization algorithms; parameters identification; power system dynamics; stability analysis; system identification,Electric power system stability; Natural resources; Nonlinear analysis; Nonlinear systems; Power electronics; Renewable energy resources; Stability; Analytical description; Nonlinear stability analysis; Optimization algorithms; Power distribution system; Power electronic converters; Region of stabilities; Renewable energy source; Source of instability; DC-DC converters,,,,,"DPI2016-78644-P; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO",This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Project IDENMRED under Grant DPI2016-78644-P.,,"Safipour, R., Sadegh, M.O., Optimal planning of energy storage systems in microgrids for improvement of operation indices (2018) Int.

By allowing users to feel each other's presence and physically manipulate objects from their interacted environments within 1 ms. The Tactile Internet facilitates fast multimodal interactions with multisensory information over the 5G network. 1 ms is a critical threshold in human perception of tactile response. For auditory response, this threshold is 100 ms and for visual response, it is 10 ms, which means delays above these thresholds are within the latency limit sensed by the human brain. In 4G, the round trip latency is 25 ms for an ideal environment. Clearly, that indicates 4G is not able to meet the requirements of tactile response. For this reason, the efforts to reduce latency in 5G are critical for Tactile Internet. Low-latency communications will also enable other digital twins' applications such as real-time control of smart grid, self-driving car, and so on. © 1994-2012 IEEE.",,Digital twin; Real time control; Auditory response; Critical threshold; Human perception; Low-latency communication; Multi-Modal Interactions; Multisensory information; Networked virtual environments; Visual response; 5G mobile communication systems,,,,,,,,"Saddik, A.E., Orozco, M., Eid, M., Cha, J., Haptics technologies: Bringing touch to multimedia (2011) Springer Series on Touch and Haptic Systems, , Berlin, Germany: Springer; Narumi, T., Kajinami, T., Nishizaka, S., Tanikawa, T., Hirose, M., Pseudogustatory, display system based on cross-modal integration of vision, olfaction and gustation (2011) Proc.

In this development, the transition of the heating sector is still in its infancy despite the relatively large share of thermal energy in the total energy consumption. Industrial companies can contribute significantly to reduce CO2 emissions by using waste heat through connecting their industrial energy supply system (IESS) to a district heating system (DHS). This paper focuses on emission reduction potential of an (industrial) heat transfer station (HTS) regarding energy flexibility and sector coupling required for the successful integration of industrial waste heat. To optimize the operating behaviour of the HTS, a data and optimization model is integrated into a digital twin (DT) based on reference architecture model for industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0). Within the DT, the information, functional and business layer are modeled. The effects of operating the HTS supported by central modules of the DT are evaluated on one year’s data of an IESS of a real industrial site. The results show a potential operating cost reduction by 6 % for the IESS and increases in profits of 1.3 % for the DHS.

However, there is a lack of an overall framework to study the top-level planning of Industrial Internet Platform (IIP) from a systematic perspective. On the other hand, there are few studies on the detailed path and steps for implementing IIP in a specific enterprise in a specific industry. The objective of this paper is to study a reference framework and industrial implementation path for IIP in product service system using industrial practice investigation method, which meets the needs of industry on the basis of existing theory and industrial practice, and to provide reference for government and industry planning, design, implementation and promotion of IIP. In addition, the proposed reference framework and industrial implementation for IIP in product service system can enhance the core value of the enterprise and increase benefits. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Industrial internet; industrial internet of things (IIoT); Industrial internet platform; Intelligent manufacturing; internet of things (IoT); Smart manufacturing,5G mobile communication systems; Computation theory; Embedded systems; Engineering education; Fog computing; Industrial research; Manufacture; Product design; Sensor networks; Industrial internet; Industrial internet of thing; Industrial internet platform; Industrial practices; Intelligent Manufacturing; Internet of thing; Investigation methods; Product-service systems; Reference frameworks; Smart manufacturing; Internet of things,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71632008, 71971139; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2018YFF0213701; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China: 2017-I-0007-0008, 2017-I-0011-0012","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71632008 , grant number 71971139 ]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant number 2018YFF0213701]; and National Major Science and Technology Project of China [grant number 2017-I-0007-0008, grant number 2017-I-0011-0012].","The authors would like to thank Producer Service Development Innovation Center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Research Center for industrial Informatics, Shanghai Key Lab of Advanced manufacturing Environment, and Startup Fund for Young Faculty at SJTU for the funding support to this research.","Makhdoom, I., Abolhasan, M., Lipman, J., Liu, R.P., Ni, W., Anatomy of Threats to the Internet of Things (2019) Ieee Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 21 (2), pp. 1636-1675; Lukichev, A., Lin, S.-W., What industrial-analytics platforms offer manufacturers (2017) Control Engineering, 64 (3), pp. 78-83; Briend, F., Armstrong, W.P., Kraguljac, N.V., Keilhloz, S.D., Lahti, A.C., Aberrant static and dynamic functional patterns of frontoparietal control network in antipsychotic-naïve first-episode psychosis subjects (2020) Human Brain Mapping, 41 (11), pp. 2999-3008; Song, J.H., (2006), IT839 Policy leading to u-Korea.

Due to the lack of an operational application architecture model, it is impossible to map the complex system comprehensively. Based on the review of the concept model of DT and the current research situation in the smart grid (SG), an OKDD [i.e., ontology-body (OB), knowledge-body (KB), data-body (DB), and digital-portal (DP)] model of digital twin body (DTB) is proposed and specified in detail. Taking a vacuum circuit breaker and a 35 kV substation of the power grid as examples, the OKDD is applied in the DTB construction, and the developed prognostic and health management (PHM) system demo is practiced in a 110 kV substation simply. The approach is proved to be feasible preliminarily. This model provides a novel method for the unified description and standardization of DTB, which is conducive to the hierarchical creation (unit-system-system of systems) for complex systems. Meanwhile, it can represent complex physical entities more comprehensively, and enable the reuse of knowledge and the duplication of similar unit-level DTB rapidly. Thus, this research provides a new reference for the practical application of DT. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Application architecture; Digital twin; Digital twin body; Smart grid,Digital twin; Electric circuit breakers; Electric power transmission networks; Hierarchical systems; System of systems; Current research situation; Information engineerings; Intelligent solutions; Operational applications; Prognostic and health management; Reliability assurance; Unified description; Vacuum circuit breaker; Smart power grids,,,,,,,,"Batty, M., Digital twins (2018) Environ Planning B Urban Anal City Sci, 45 (5), pp. 817-820; Brosinsky, C., Westermann, D., Krebs, R., Recent and prospective developments in power system control centers: Adapting the digital twin technology for application in power system control centers (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE International Energy Conference (ENERGYCON), pp. 1-6. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ENERGYCON.2018.8398846; Cao, J., Wan, Y., Tu, G., Zhang, S., Xia, A., Liu, X., Chen, Z., Lu, C., Information system architecture for smart grids (2013) Chin J Comput, 36 (1), pp. 143-167; Chen, S., Chen, Z., The research of organizational knowledge management based on the differentiation between static knowledge and dynamic knowledge (2007) Sci Manage Res, 25 (2), pp. 69-72; Chen, Y., Chen, Y., Pei, Z., Wang, C., Digital twin: recent development and future trend from a bibliometrics perspective (2020) China Mech Eng, 31 (7), pp. 797-807; Dai, S., Zhao, G., Yu, Y., Wang, W., Trend of digital product definition: from mock-up to twin (2018) J Comput-Aided Design Comput Graphics, 30 (8), pp. 1554-1562; Fischer, G., Enhancing incremental learning processes with knowledge-based systems (1988) Learning issues for intelligent tutoring systems.

Particularly in the smart grid, the high costs of some devices and especially the imminent need to not be able to manipulate these devices in production environments make necessary mechanisms that allow the manipulation of these physical objects in virtual environments; this has been called a digital twin. On the other hand, cyberattacks are growing in all cyber-physical systems, and in the smart grid, cybersecurity is essential due to the smart grid is a critical infrastructure. This work shows a small implementation of a digital twin system for smart metering systems in a smart home environment for testing cybersecurity issues. The results show that the use of digital twins is feasible in various contexts of the smart grid in particularly in cybersecurity testing IEEE",,Automation; Cyber Physical System; Digital devices; Digital twin; Embedded systems; Security of data; Smart power grids; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; High costs; Physical objects; Production environments; Smart grid; Smart homes; Smart metering; Electric power transmission networks,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,10897801,,IICOF,,English,IEEE Internet Comput,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102308701

Under the term Industry 4.0, promising possibilities for high-performance production processes are emerging based on e.g., digital twins and cyber-physical systems. However, the construction industry lags behind in adapting these ideas, and is still facing severe productivity deficits. This paper addresses these deficits by assessing the hypothesis of Building Information Modeling-as the digital twinning methodology in construction-representing a key driver for digital automation and thus enabling more productive processes. To this end, we apply a design science research approach to develop artefacts using computational methods for the automation of business processes in a configure-to-order industry partner. The evaluation is done in the context of a pilot project together with this industry partner. The findings obtained in the pilot project revealed time savings in the phases of bid estimation and work preparation. Based on the findings, the applicability and utility of the suggested approach are discussed and allow for the conclusion that Building Information Model data can usefully streamline and automate many processes at the interface between design and production, if structured and preprocessed purposefully. © 2019 by the authors.",BIM; Configure-to-order; Construction equipment; Cyber-physical production systems; Digital information flow; Digital twins; Industry 4.0; Lean assembly,,,,,,"Libera Università di Bolzano, UNIBZ","sincerely would like to thank the company Niederst?tter, located in South Tyrol, Italy, for giving us the opportunity to carry out the evaluation phase on a pilot project and providing us with valuable data for analysis.

In this paper, the authors propose several requirements that a DT of a water distribution system should accomplish. Developing a DT is a challenge, and a continuous process of adjustments and learning is required. Due to the advantages of having a DT of the WDS always available, during the last years a strategy to build and maintain a DT of the water distribution network of Valencia (Spain) and its Metropolitan Area (1.6 million inhabitants) was developed. This is one of the first DTs built of a water utility, being currently in operation. The great benefits of their use in the daily operation of the system ensure that they will begin to be usual in the most advanced smart cities. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",detailed model; Digital Twin; Epanet; planning operation and maintenance; real time; Water Distribution Systems,distribution system; drinking water; metropolitan area; modeling; real time; smart city; water management; water planning; water supply; Comunidad Valencia; Spain; Valencia [Comunidad Valencia]; Valencia [Valencia (PRV)]; Valencia,,,,,,,,"Bartolín, H., Martínez, F., Cortés, J.A., Bringing up to Date WDS Models by Querying.

This can be achieved by applying multimodal rehabilitation regimens, such as thought-controlled exoskeletons or epidural electrical stimulation to recover motor pattern generation in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the human neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) system has often been oversimplified in designing rehabilitative and assistive devices. As a result, the neuromechanics of the muscles is seldom considered when modeling the relationship between electrical stimulation, mechanical assistance from exoskeletons, and final joint movement. A powerful way to enhance current neurorehabilitation is to develop the next generation prostheses incorporating personalized NMS models of patients. This strategy will enable an individual voluntary interfacing with multiple electromechanical rehabilitation devices targeting key afferent and efferent systems for functional improvement. This narrative review discusses how real-time NMS models can be integrated with finite element (FE) of musculoskeletal tissues and interface multiple assistive and robotic devices with individuals with SCI to promote neural restoration. In particular, the utility of NMS models for optimizing muscle stimulation patterns, tracking functional improvement, monitoring safety, and providing augmented feedback during exercisebased rehabilitation are discussed. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag.

The application of such advanced capabilities particularly to highly digitalized processes such as metal additive manufacturing (AM) is likely to make those processes commercially more attractive. AI capabilities will reside within Digital Twins (DTs) which are living virtual replicas of the physical processes. DTs will be empowered to operate autonomously in a diagnostic control capacity to supervise processes and can be interrogated by the practitioner to inform the optimal processing route for any given product. The utility of the information gained from the DTs would depend on the quality of the digital models and, more importantly, their faster-solving surrogates which dwell within DTs for consultation during rapid decision-making. In this article, we point out the exceptional value of DTs in AM and focus on the need to create high-fidelity multiscale-multiphysics models for AM processes to feed the AI capabilities. We identify technical hurdles for their development, including those arising from the multiscale and multiphysics characteristics of the models, the difficulties in linking models of the subprocesses across scales and physics, and the scarcity of experimental data. We discuss the need for creating surrogate models using machine learning approaches for real-time problem-solving. We further identify non-technical barriers, such as the need for standardization and difficulties in collaborating across different types of institutions. We offer potential solutions for all these challenges, after reflecting on and researching discussions held at an international symposium on the subject in 2019. We argue that a collaborative approach can not only help accelerate their development compared with disparate efforts, but also enhance the quality of the models by allowing modular development and linkages that account for interactions between the various sub-processes in AM. A high-level roadmap is suggested for starting such a collaboration. © 2021 The Authors",Additive manufacturing; Artificial intelligence; Digital twins; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Multiphysics modeling; Multiscale modeling,Additives; Decision making; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Problem solving; Digital modeling; Machine-learning; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing process; Metal additives; Multi-physics modeling; Multiscale models; Process productivity; Process products; Products quality; 3D printers,,,,,"Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO; RMIT University, RMIT; University of Melbourne, UNIMELB","The authors thank the delegates of the International ?Towards a Digital Twin of Metal Additive Manufacturing?

Their application for supporting real-time operational decisions has been also gaining increasing interest over the past decade. Accurate end-user nodal demands are critical to the reliability of hydraulic simulations for real-time decision support. Conventionally, nodal demands are set to a handful of periodically updated ensembles of demand patterns, which cannot represent the vast heterogeneity and volatility of demands. With advances in metering technology, consumption data with unprecedentedly high temporal and spatial resolutions are available to water utilities on a real-time basis. A framework is developed here to create a dynamic demand assignment hydraulic model, in which consumption data are assigned to nodes to update the water network model with the streaming data from the data center and without interruption of the hydraulic simulation run. The developed framework is cloud-based and scalable, making it suitable for water distribution systems of all sizes. The framework modifies the core EPANET engine to directly assign updated demands in order to overcome current software limitations. The model is applied and demonstrated using a real-world case study in the US. The results show the importance of the real-time demand assignment for the reliability of hydraulic models for making real-time operational decisions and the realization of digital twins of water infrastructure systems. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Data integration; Decision support systems; Digital twin; Hydraulic models; Smart meters; Water distribution systems; Water supply; Design and planning; Hydraulic simulation; Metering technology; Operational decisions; Real time decisions; Temporal and spatial; Water distribution system models; Water infrastructure; Real time systems; computer simulation; data set; decision making; hydrological modeling; real time; resource management; water demand; water management; United States,,,,,,,,"Alves, Z., Muranho, J., Albuquerque, T., Ferreira, A., Water distribution network's modeling and calibration: A case study based on scarce inventory data (2014) Procedia Eng., 70, pp. 31-40. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2014.02.005; Cocking, S., Business showcase: Sensus (2017) Irish Tech News, , September 7, 2017; Cominola, A., Giuliani, M., Castelletti, A., Rosenberg, D., Abdallah, A., Implications of data sampling resolution on water use simulation, end-use disaggregation, and demand management (2018) Environ.

Here, DTs for UWS are placed in the context of DTs at the component, unit process/operation or hydraulic structure, treatment plant, system, city, and societal levels. A UWS DT is characterized as a systematic virtual representation of the elements and dynamics of the physical system, organized in a star-structure with a set of features connected by data links that are based on standards for open data. This allows the overall functionality to be broken down into smaller, tangible units (features), enabling microservices that communicate via data links to emerge (the most central feature), facilitated by application programing interfaces (APIs). Coupled to the physical system, simulation models and advanced analytics are among the most important features. We propose distinguishing between living and prototyping DTs, where the term “living” refers to coupling observations from an ever-changing physical twin (which may change with, e.g., urban growth) with a simulation model, through a data link connecting the two. A living DT is thus a near real-time representation of an UWS and can be used for operational and control purposes. A prototyping DT represents a scenario for the system without direct coupling to real-time observations, which can be used for design or planning. By acknowledging that different DTs exist, it is possible to identify the value-creation from DTs achieved by different end-users inside and outside a utility organization. Analyzing the DT workflow in VCS shows that a DT must be multifunctional, updateable, and adjustable to support potential value creation across the utility company. This study helps clarify key DT terminology for UWS and identifies steps to create a DT by building upon digital ecosystems (DEs) and open standards for data. © 2021 by the authors.

This data-sharing, trough the big data management techniques, is a fully integrated base on which digital tools can be installed and exchange information. Data stored from physical world of machines can be redirected to simulation environments like Digital Twins and can be inspected, for several purposes like predictive analysis, by humans too. On top of these scopes, within the realization of an Internet of Things, there is safety, especially in industrial sites where injury risk for operators and workers is a key factor for production sustainability. This paper, starting from a tested case study in mechanical stressed monitoring, focuses on the application of upgraded augmented reality systems for safety practices, expanding the area of interest to electric and overheating risk mitigation in electrical equipment and to emergency management. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Forecasting oil and gas production needs to capture the ranges of the multitude of uncertain parameters and their impact on the forecast to maximize the value of the project for the company. Several authors showed, however, that the oil and gas industry has challenges in adequately assessing the distributions of hydrocarbon production forecasts. The methods for forecasting hydrocarbon production developed with digitalization from using analytical solutions to numerical models with an increasing number of gridblocks (“digital twins”) toward ensembles of models covering the uncertainty of the various parameters. Analytical solutions and single numerical models allow calculation of incremental production for a single case. However, neither the uncertainty of the forecasts nor the question in which the distribution of various outcomes the single model is located can be determined. Ensemble-based forecasts are able to address these questions, but they need to be able to cover a large number of uncertain parameters and the amount of data that is generated accordingly. Theory-guided data science (TGDS) approaches have recently been used to overcome these challenges. Such approaches make use of the scientific knowledge captured in numerical models to generate a sufficiently large data set to apply data science approaches. These approaches can be combined with economics to determine the desirability of a project for a company (expected utility). Quantitative decision analysis, including a value of information (VoI) calculation, can be done addressing the uncertainty range but also the risk hurdles as required by the decision-maker (DM). The next step is the development of learning agent systems (agent: autonomous, goal-directed entity that observes and acts upon an environment) that are able to cope with the large amount of data generated by sensors and to use them for conditioning models to data and use the data in decision analysis. Companies need to address the challenges of data democratization to integrate and use the available data, organizational agility, and the development of data science skills but making sure that the technical skills, which are required for the TGDS approach, are kept.

Cyber-physical production systems and digital twins of the product and process already provide the means to predict possible future states of the final product, given the current production parameters. With the advent of further data integration coupled with the need for autonomous decision-making, methods are needed to make decisions in real time and in an environment of uncertainty in both the possible outcomes and in the stakeholders' preferences over them. This article proposes a method of autonomous decision-making in data-intensive environments, such as a cyber-physical assembly system. Theoretical results in group decision-making and utility maximization using mixture distributions are presented. This allows us to perform calculations on expected utility accurately and efficiently through closed-form expressions, which are also provided. The practical value of the method is illustrated with a door assembly example and compared to traditional random assembly methods and results. © 2019 SAE International.",,Assembly; Cyber Physical System; Data integration; Industry 4.0; Mixtures; Autonomous decision; Closed-form expression; Current production; Group Decision Making; Mixture distributions; Possible futures; Production system; Utility maximizations; Decision making,,,,,,,,"Kemper, H.G., Fettke, P., Feld, T., Hoffmann, M., Industry 4.0 (2014) Business & Information Systems Engineering, (4), pp. 239-242; Lee, J., Bagheri, B., Kao, H.-A., A Cyber-Physical Systems Architecture for Industry 4.0-Based Manufacturing Systems (2015) Manufacturing Letters, 3, pp. 18-23; Negri, E., Fumagalli, L., MacChi, M., (2017) A Review of the Roles of Digital Twin in CPS-Based Production Systems, , in 27th International Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing, Modena, Italy; Radziwon, A., Bilberg, A., Bogers, M., Madsen, E.S., (2013) The Smart Factory: Exploring Adaptive and Flexible Manufacturing Solutions, , in 24th DAAAM International Symposium on Intelligent Manufacturing and Automation; Hu, S.J., Evolving Paradigms of Manufacturing: From Mass Production to Mass Customization and Personalization (2013) Procedia CIRP, 3 (8); Von, N.J., Morgenstern, O., (1964) Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, , New York, NY, USA: J.

Using mobile devices, Augmented Reality can overlay 3D digital data into the world. In this paper, we demonstrate how Augmented Reality can be used to enrich 3D printed urban models to show competing designs, replace outdated physical designs, and contextualize urban models within a larger urban context. Using a digital twin and accurate physical occlusion, we show how Augmented Reality can be used in workshop settings to enable interactive demonstrations, encourage design exploration, and turn physical urban models into evolving comparative design tools. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH ꞏ.",Augmented reality; Stakeholder participation; Urban models; Visualization,,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: P/R024979/1; Technische Universiteit Delft, TU Delft; South China University of Technology, SCUT",This research is supported by the Newton Fund/Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) as part of the Sustainable Deltas award (No. P/R024979/1).

Here, we present a novel projection pursuit recurrent neural network to identify functional mechanisms in the context of iterative supervised machine learning for discovery-based design optimization. Molecular function recognition is achieved by pairing experiments that categorize systems with digital twin molecular dynamics simulations to generate working hypotheses. Feature extraction decomposes emergent properties of a system into a complete set of basis vectors. Feature selection requires signal-to-noise, statistical significance, and clustering quality to concurrently surpass acceptance levels. Formulated as a multivariate description of differences and similarities between systems, the data-driven working hypothesis is refined by analyzing new systems prioritized by a discovery-likelihood. Utility and generality are demonstrated on several benchmarks, including the elucidation of antibiotic resistance in TEM-52 beta-lactamase. The software is freely available, enabling turnkey analysis of massive data streams found in computational biology and material science. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,"Carloni, P., Rothlisberger, U., Parrinello, M., The role and perspective of ab initio molecular dynamics in the study of biological systems (2002) Acc.

Barriers to residential Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) autonomy as a service, include operational challenges in run-time safety compliance, reliability and resilience, due to the complexities of dealing with known and unknown risk in dynamic environments. In this paper we incorporate a Symbiotic System Of Systems Approach (SSOSA) that uses a Symbiotic Digital Architecture (SDA) to provide a cyber physical orchestration of enabling technologies. Implementing a SSOSA enables Cooperation, Collaboration and Corroboration (C3), as to address run-time verification of safety, reliability and resilience during autonomous missions. Our SDA provides a means to synchronize distributed digital models of the robot, environment and infrastructure. Through the coordinated bidirectional communication network of the SDA, the remote human operator has improved visibility and understanding of the mission profile. We evaluate our SSOSA in an asset inspection mission within a confined operating environment. Demonstrating the ability of our SSOSA to overcome safety, reliability and resilience challenges. The SDA supports lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing across the interconnected systems. Our results evaluate both sudden and gradual faults, as well as unknown events, that may jeopardize an autonomous mission. Using distributed and coordinated decision making, the SSOSA enhances the analysis of the mission status, which includes diagnostics of critical sub-systems within the resident robot. This evaluation demonstrates that the SSOSA provides enhanced run-time operational resilience and safety compliance to BVLOS autonomous missions. The SSOSA has the potential to be a highly transferable methodology to other mission scenarios and technologies, providing a pathway to implementing scalable autonomy as a service. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; autonomous systems; digital twin; non-destructive evaluation; resilient robotics; safety compliance; sensors; symbiotic systems; system ontology,Decision making; Electric utilities; Life cycle; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind farms; Reliability; Robotics; Safety engineering; Systems engineering; Autonomous system; Digital architecture; Non destructive evaluation; Resilient robotic; Safety compliances; Sensor; Symbiotic system; Symbiotics; System ontology; System-of-system approach; Nondestructive examination,,,,,"PCT/GB2017/053275; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/R026173/1","This work was supported in part by the Offshore Robotic for Certification of Assets (ORCA) Hub under EPSRC Project EP/R026173/1, EPSRC Holistic Operation and Maintenance for Energy (HOME) from Offshore Wind Farms; and in part by MicroSense Technologies Ltd.

Although vehicular edge caching can facilitate delay-bounded content transmission, constrained storage capacity and limited serving range of an individual cache server as well as highly dynamic topology of vehicular networks may degrade the efficiency of content delivery. To address the problem, in this article, we propose a social-aware vehicular edge caching mechanism that dynamically orchestrates the cache capability of roadside units (RSUs) and smart vehicles according to user preference similarity and service availability. Furthermore, catering to the complexity and variability of vehicular social characteristics, we leverage the digital twin technology to map the edge caching system into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the social relation model. Based on the social model, a new concept of vehicular cache cloud is developed to incorporate the correlation of content storing between multiple cache-enabled vehicles in diverse traffic environments. Then, we propose deep learning empowered optimal caching schemes, jointly considering the social model construction, cache cloud formation, and cache resource allocation. We evaluate the proposed schemes based on real traffic data. Numerical results demonstrate that our edge caching schemes have great advantages in optimizing caching utility.

It reviews the concept of ME and integrates ME with a MBSE framework for the development of the DT. The methodology is demonstrated through a case study where the UAS is deployed for a Last Mile Delivery (LMD) mission in a military context where adversaries are present, and a route optimization module recommends an optimal route to the user based on a variety of inputs including potential damage or destruction of the UAS by adversary action. The optimization module is based on Multiple Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) which analyzes predefined criteria which the user assessed would enable the successful conduct of the UAS mission. The article demonstrates that the methodology can execute a ME analysis for route selection to support a user’s decision-making process. The discussion section highlights the key MBSE artifacts and also highlights the benefits of the methodology which standardizes the decision-making process thereby reducing the negative impact of human factors which may deviate from the predefined criteria. © 2021 by the authors.

This is not a straightforward task because neither the relationship between the size of the userbase or its effectiveness is easily quantified, nor is it clear which threshold for the number of users would make the application ‘effective’. This paper presents an approach for estimating the number of users needed for location‐based crowdsourcing applications to work successfully, depending on the use case, the circumstances, and the criteria of success. It circumvents various issues, ethical or practical, in performing real‐world controlled experiments and tackles this challenge by developing an agent‐based modelling and simulation framework. This framework is tested on a specific scenario, that of missing children and the search for them. The search is performed with the contribution of citizens being made aware of the disappearance through a mobile application. The result produces an easily reconfigurable testbed for the effectiveness of citizen sensing mobile applications, allowing the study of the marginal utility of new users of the application. The resulting framework aims to be the digital twin of a real urban scenario, and it has been designed to be easily adapted and support decisions on the feasibility, evaluation, and targeting of the deployment of spatial crowdsourcing applications. © 2021 by the authors.

The chemical plants on site are heavily interconnected, i.e., the product of one plant is the raw material used in the next one and some of the plants use the steam produced from neighboring ones. This high degree of interconnection makes it quite difficult to assess the feasibility let alone the economic optimality of production and maintenance plans for the entire site. This research explores the use of a data-driven digital twin to simulate and assess these plans. Two value chains, i.e., a collection of plants converting raw material to valuable end products have been selected as a proof-of-concept for the entire site. Each plant has been modeled by utilizing simple or multiple regression. Each regression model correlates the final product of a plant with the needed raw materials or utilities (e.g., steam or electricity). All regression models have been found using the software JMP. Additionally, all relevant tanks used to stock raw materials, intermediates and final products have been modelled. This allowed for the visualization and troubleshooting of a particular component excess or shortage. The resulting system of 76 variables has been solved in MATLAB in a multi-period fashion, where a period represents a day. The simulation has been first performed on the training data set, and then on a validation period to verify the models' performance.

Cast resin transformers are not flammable and are also resistant to moisture. However, their thermalelectrical degradation must be carefully analysed given the special conditions of wind farm installations. The present paper studies the remaining useful life (RUL) calculation of dry-type WTSU transformers based on the most thermally stressed location i.e. the winding hot-spot. The estimation of the loss of life of the transformer can be used for diagnostic and prognostic monitoring purposes in the framework of digital twins. The methodology is then applied to a typical WTSU load profile and the impact of several transformer characteristics and operating conditions are compared to the reference case. © 2020, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

It incorporates a routing algorithm to build vehicle routes and an upper confidence bound based algorithm for a generalized linear contextual bandit algorithm to identify alternatives which are acceptable to passengers. As a contextual bandit algorithm, the added context from the routing subproblem makes it unclear how effective learning is under such circumstances. We propose a new simulation experimental framework to evaluate the impact of adding the routing constraints to the destination recommender algorithm. The proposed algorithm is first tested on a 7 by 7 grid network and performs better than benchmarks that include random alternatives, selecting the highest rating, or selecting the destination with the smallest vehicle routing cost increase. The RecoMOD algorithm also reduces average increases in vehicle travel costs compared to using random or highest rating recommendation. Its application to Manhattan dataset with ratings for 1,012 destinations reveals that a higher customer arrival rate and faster vehicle speeds lead to better acceptance rates. While these two results sound contradictory, they provide important managerial insights for MOD operators.
